Chiune &quot; Sempo &quot; Sugihara ( 杉原 千畝 , Sugihara Chiune ? , 1 January 1900 – 31 July 1986 ) was a Japanese diplomat who served as Vice-Consul for the Empire of Japan in Lithuania .

bus stop of Chiune-cho where the name of Sugihara Chiune was derived .

while in Harbin , he got married to Klaudia Semionovna Apollonova .

Chiune Sugihara also served in the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as a translator for the Japanese legation in Helsinki , Finland .
in 1939 , Sugihara became a vice-consul of the Japanese Consulate in Kaunas , Lithuania .
his duties included reporting on Soviet and German troop movements , and to find out if Germany planned an attack on the Soviets and , if so , to report the details of this attack to his superiors in Berlin and Tokyo .
Sugihara had cooperated with Polish intelligence as part of a bigger Japanese – Polish cooperative plan .
as the Soviet Union occupied sovereign Lithuania in 1940 , many Jewish refugees from Poland ( Polish Jews ) as well as Lithuanian Jews tried to acquire exit visas .
at the time , on the brink of the war , Lithuanian Jews made up one third of Lithuania &apos;s urban population and half of the residents of every town as well .
most of the refugees did not fulfill these criteria .
Sugihara dutifully contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry three times for instructions .
each time , the Ministry responded that anybody granted a visa should have a visa to a third destination to exit Japan , with no exceptions .
from 18 July to 28 August 1940 , aware that applicants were in danger if they stayed behind , Sugihara decided to grant visas on his own .
he ignored the requirements and issued ten-day visas to Jews for transit through Japan , in violation of his orders .
given his inferior post and the culture of the Japanese Foreign Service bureaucracy , this was an unusual act of disobedience .
he spoke to Soviet officials who agreed to let the Jews travel through the country via the Trans-Siberian Railway at five times the standard ticket price .
Sugihara explained that the refugees were human beings , and that they simply needed help .
people in Tokyo were not united .
I felt it silly to deal with them .
so , I made up my mind not to wait for their reply .
I knew that somebody would surely complain about me in the future .
but , I myself thought this would be the right thing to do .
there is nothing wrong in saving many people &apos;s lives .
the spirit of humanity , philanthropy .
neighborly friendship .
with this spirit , I ventured to do what I did , confronting this most difficult situation — and because of this reason , I went ahead with redoubled courage .
Sugihara died the following year at a hospital in Kamakura , on 31 July 1986 .
in spite of the publicity given him in Israel and other nations , he remained virtually unknown in his home country .

Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov ( Russian : Даши-Доржо Итигэлов ; Buryat : Этигэлэй Дашадоржо ; 1852 – 1927 ) was a Buryat Buddhist lama of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition , best known for the lifelike state of his dead body , which is reported not to be subject to macroscopic decay .
Itigilov was born in 1852 and began his religious education at the age of sixteen years .
he studied at the Anninsky Datsan ( a Buddhist teaching monastery in Buryatia , of which only ruins remain ) , earning diplomas in medicine and philosophy .
at that time he wrote an encyclopedia of pharmacology .
in 1911 , he was appointed the twelfth Pandido Khambo Lama ( as the head of Russian Buryat Buddhists is styled ) , at which post he inaugurated the period of a Buddhist revival among Buryats .
between 1913 and 1917 , Itigilov was prominent in the spiritual life of Imperial Russia .
he took part in the Tercentenary celebrations of the House of Romanov and opened the Datsan Gunzechoinei , the first Buddhist temple in St.
he also helped set up a number of hospitals , with lama doctors helping wounded soldiers .
for his charitable activities Itigilov was awarded the Order of St.
Lamas did not want to perform this meditation because Itigilov was still alive .
one of the testament clauses stipulated that his body should be exhumed by other monks within several years .

Davydov soliton is a quantum quasiparticle representing an excitation propagating along the protein α-helix self-trapped amide I.
it is a solution of the Davydov Hamiltonian .
it is named for the Soviet and Ukrainian physicist Alexander Davydov .
the Davydov model describes the interaction of the amide I vibrations with the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the α-helix of proteins .
the elementary excitations within the α-helix are given by the phonons which correspond to the deformational oscillations of the lattice , and the excitons which describe the internal amide I excitations of the peptide groups .
this effect is called self-localization or self-trapping .
on the other hand , an asymmetric soliton which spontaneously breaks the local translational and helical symmetries possesses the lowest energy and is a robust localized entity .
Davydov &apos;s Hamiltonian is formally similar to the Fröhlich-Holstein Hamiltonian for the interaction of electrons with a polarizable lattice .
thus the Hamiltonian of the energy operator H ^ { \ displaystyle { \ hat { H } } } is .
where H ^ qp { \ displaystyle { \ hat { H } } _ { \ text { qp } } } is the quasiparticle ( exciton ) Hamiltonian , which describes the motion of the amide I excitations between adjacent sites ; H ^ ph { \ displaystyle { \ hat { H } } _ { \ text { ph } } } is the phonon Hamiltonian , which describes the vibrations of the lattice ; and H ^ int { \ displaystyle { \ hat { H } } _ { \ text { int } } } is the interaction Hamiltonian , which describes the interaction of the amide I excitation with the lattice .
the quasiparticle ( exciton ) Hamiltonian H ^ qp { \ displaystyle { \ hat { H } } _ { \ text { qp } } } is : .
where the index n = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N { \ displaystyle n = 1,2 , \ cdots , N } counts the peptide groups along the α-helix spine , the index α = 1 , 2 , 3 { \ displaystyle \ alpha = 1,2,3 } counts each α-helix spine , E 0 = 3 .
28 × 10 − 20 { \ displaystyle E _ { 0 } = 3 .
28 \ times 10 ^ { -20 } } J is the energy of the amide I vibration ( CO stretching ) , J = 2 .
46 × 10 − 22 { \ displaystyle J = 2 .
46 \ times 10 ^ { -22 } } J is the dipole-dipole coupling energy between a particular amide I bond and those ahead and behind along the same spine , L = 1 .
55 × 10 − 22 { \ displaystyle L = 1 .
55 \ times 10 ^ { -22 } } J is the dipole-dipole coupling energy between a particular amide I bond and those on adjacent spines in the same unit cell of the protein α-helix , A ^ n , α † { \ displaystyle { \ hat { A } } _ { n , \ alpha } ^ { \ dagger } } and A ^ n , α { \ displaystyle { \ hat { A } } _ { n , \ alpha } } are respectively the boson creation and annihilation operator for a quasiparticle at the peptide group .
N , α { \ displaystyle n , \ alpha } .
the phonon Hamiltonian H ^ ph { \ displaystyle { \ hat { H } } _ { \ text { ph } } } is .
where u ^ n , α { \ displaystyle { \ hat { u } } _ { n , \ alpha } } is the displacement operator from the equilibrium position of the peptide group n , α { \ displaystyle n , \ alpha } , p ^ n , α { \ displaystyle { \ hat { p } } _ { n , \ alpha } } is the momentum operator of the peptide group n , α { \ displaystyle n , \ alpha } , M is the mass of each peptide group , and w = 19 .
5 { \ displaystyle w = 19 .
5 } N m − 1 { \ displaystyle ^ { -1 } } is an effective elasticity coefficient of the lattice ( the spring constant of a hydrogen bond ) .
finally , the interaction Hamiltonian H ^ int { \ displaystyle { \ hat { H } } _ { \ text { int } } } is .
where χ = − 30 { \ displaystyle \ chi = -30 } pN is an anharmonic parameter arising from the coupling between the quasiparticle ( exciton ) and the lattice displacements ( phonon ) and parameterizes the strength of the exciton-phonon interaction .
the value of this parameter for α-helix has been determined via comparison of the theoretically calculated absorption line shapes with the experimentally measured ones .
the mathematical techniques that are used to analyze Davydov &apos;s soliton are similar to some that have been developed in polaron theory .
in this context the Davydov &apos;s soliton corresponds to a polaron that is ( i ) large so the continuum limit approximation is justified , ( ii ) acoustic because the self-localization arises from interactions with acoustic modes of the lattice , and ( iii ) weakly coupled because the anharmonic energy is small compared with the phonon bandwidth .
the Davydov soliton is a quantum quasiparticle and it obeys Heisenberg &apos;s uncertainty principle .
thus any model that does not impose translational invariance is flawed by construction .
supposing that the Davydov soliton is localized to 5 turns of the α-helix results in significant uncertainty in the velocity of the soliton Δ v = 133 { \ displaystyle \ Delta v = 133 } m / s , a fact that is obscured if one models the Davydov soliton as a classical object .
there are three possible fundamental approaches towards Davydov model : ( I ) the quantum theory , in which both the amide I vibration ( excitons ) and the lattice site motion ( phonons ) are treated quantum mechanically ; ( ii ) the mixed quantum-classical theory , in which the amide I vibration is treated quantum mechanically but the lattice is classical ; and ( iii ) the classical theory , in which both the amide I and the lattice motions are treated classically .

&quot; James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars , saying &quot; This is a smartly written comedy with a soft emotional core .
&quot; Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film three out of four stars , saying &quot; Despicable Me may not be the most sophisticated kids movie ever , but it stacks up against recent animated fare like How To Train Your Dragon the way The New York Review of Books compares to USA Today .
&quot; Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars , saying &quot; An improbably heartwarming , not to mention visually delightful , diversion .
&quot; Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film four out of four stars , saying &quot; This animated thing pretty near out-Pixars Pixar .
&quot; Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of four stars , saying &quot; When compared with the ambition and achievement of recent animated films , such as Coraline and Toy Story 3 , Despicable Me hardly seems to have been worth making , and it &apos;s barely worth watching .
so the makers of Despicable Me were wise to cut to the chase and make the megalomaniacal Gru the central character in this animated film .

in string theory , there is also a dilaton in the worldsheet CFT ( Conformal field theory ) .
therefore , the coupling constant is a dynamical variable in string theory , unlike the case of quantum field theory where it is constant .
as long as supersymmetry is unbroken , such scalar fields can take arbitrary values ( they are moduli ) .
however , supersymmetry breaking usually creates a potential energy for the scalar fields and the scalar fields localize near a minimum whose position should in principle be calculable in string theory .
the dilaton acts like a Brans – Dicke scalar , with the effective Planck scale depending upon both the string scale and the dilaton field .
in supersymmetry , the superpartner of the dilaton is called the dilatino , and the dilaton combines with the axion to form a complex scalar field .
the dilaton-gravity action is .
this is more general than Brans – Dicke in vacuum in that we have a dilaton potential .

in particle physics , a diquark , or diquark correlation / clustering , is a hypothetical state of two quarks grouped inside a baryon ( that consists of three quarks ) ( Lichtenberg 1982 ) .
the diquark is often treated as a single subatomic particle with which the third quark interacts via the strong interaction .
diquark – antidiquark pairs have also been advanced for anomalous particles such as the X ( 3872 ) .
the forces between the two quarks in a diquark is attractive when both the colors and spins are antisymmetric .
&#91; clarification needed &#93; When both quarks are correlated in this way they tend to form a very low energy configuration .
this low energy configuration has become known as a diquark .
many scientists theorize that a diquark should not be considered a particle .
even though they may contain two quarks they are not colour neutral , and therefore cannot exist as isolated bound states .
this also happens to be the same size as the hadron itself .
there are many different pieces of evidence that prove diquarks are fundamental in the structure of hadrons .
one of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from a recent study of baryons .
in this study the baryon had one heavy and two light quarks .
in the experiment the quarks ionized the vacuum area .
this produced the quark – antiquark pairs , which then converted themselves into mesons .
when generating a baryon by assembling quarks , it is helpful if the quarks first form a stable two-quark state .
the Λ and the Σ are created as a result of up , down and strange quarks .
scientists &#91; who ? &#93; found that the Λ contains the &#91; ud &#93; diquark , however the Σ does not .
from this experiment scientists inferred that Λ baryons are more common &#91; clarification needed &#93; than Σ baryons , and indeed they are more common by a factor of 10 .

Edward Cave ( 27 February 1691 – 10 January 1754 ) was an English printer , editor and publisher .
he coined the term &quot; magazine &quot; for a periodical , founding The Gentleman &apos;s Magazine in 1731 , and was the first publisher to successfully fashion a wide-ranging publication .
the son of a cobbler , Cave was born in Newton near Rugby , Warwickshire and attended Rugby School , but was expelled after being accused of stealing from the headmaster Henry Holyoake .
he worked at a variety of jobs , including timber merchant , reporter and printer .
he conceived the idea of a periodical that would cover every topic the educated public was interested in , from commerce to poetry , and tried to convince several London printers and booksellers to take up the idea .
when no one showed any interest , Cave took on the task by himself .
the Gentleman &apos;s Magazine was launched in 1731 and soon became the most influential and most imitated periodical of its time .
it also made Cave wealthy .
cave was an astute businessman .
he devoted all his energy to the magazine , and rarely left its offices at St John &apos;s Gate , Clerkenwell .
he made use of a large number of contributors , most famously Samuel Johnson , who was always grateful to Cave for having provided his principal employment for many years .
cave himself often contributed pieces to the Magazine under the pen name of Sylvanus Urban .
he also obtained a licence from Lewis Paul for 250 spindles for his patent roller-spinning machine , a precursor of the water frame .
in 1742 he bought Marvel &apos;s Mill at Northampton and converted this to a cotton mill , probably the first water-powered spinning mill in the world .
this was apparently profitable , but only modestly so .
it closed in ( or possibly soon after ) 1761 .
cave suffered from gout .
he is buried at St.
James Church , Clerkenwell .

Einar Ingvald Haugen ( / ˈhaʊɡən / ; April 19 , 1906 – June 20 , 1994 ) was an American linguist , author and Professor at University of Wisconsin – Madison and Harvard University .
Haugen was born in Sioux City , Iowa to Norwegians from the town of Oppdal in Norway .
when he was a young child , the family moved back to Oppdal for a few years , but then returned to the United States .
he attended Morningside College in Sioux City but transferred to St.
Olaf College to study with Ole Edvart Rølvaag .
he earned his B.
in 1928 and immediately went on to graduate studies in linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , where he was awarded his Ph.
in 1931 .
in 1931 Haugen joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin – Madison , where he stayed until 1962 .
he was made Victor S.
Thomas Professor of Scandinavian and Linguistics at Harvard University in 1964 , and stayed here until his retirement in 1975 .
Haugen served as president of the Linguistic Society of America , the American Dialect Society , and the Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study .
Haugen was also a member of the Board of Editors of the Norwegian-American Historical Association .
in 1972 he was awarded an honorary degree , doctor philos .
honoris causa , at the Norwegian Institute of Technology , later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology .
Haugen is credited for having pioneered &#91; citation needed &#93; the field of sociolinguistics and being a leading scholar within the field of Norwegian-American studies , including Old Norse studies .
perhaps his most important work was The Norwegian language in America ; A study in bilingual behavior ( ISBN 0-253-34115-9 ) .
in addition to several important works within these fields , he wrote the authoritative work on the dialect of his ancestral home of Oppdal and a book entitled The Ecology of Language , with which he pioneered a new field of linguistics later called Ecolinguistics .
Einar Haugen also wrote Norwegian American Dictionary / Norsk engelsk ordbok ( ISBN 0-299-03874-2 ) .
the Einar and Eva Lund Haugen Memorial Scholarship has been established by the Norwegian-American Historical Association to honor Einar Haugen and his wife Eva Lund Haugen .
he is often known simply as Eisai / Yōsai Zenji ( 栄西禅師 ) , literally &quot; Zen master Eisai &quot; .
a total solar eclipse occurred on October 24 , 1995 .
a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun , thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth .
a total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon &apos;s apparent diameter is larger than the Sun &apos;s , blocking all direct sunlight , turning day into darkness .
totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth &apos;s surface , with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide .
the path of totality went through the Middle East , Asia , Indonesia .
each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours ( a semester ) at alternating nodes of the Moon &apos;s orbit .
it is a part of Saros cycle 143 , repeating every 18 years , 11 days , containing 72 events .
the series started with partial solar eclipse on March 7 , 1617 and total event from June 24 , 1797 through October 24 , 1995 .
it has hybrid eclipses from November 3 , 2013 through December 6 , 2067 , and annular eclipses from December 16 , 2085 through September 16 , 2536 .
the series ends at member 72 as a partial eclipse on April 23 , 2873 .
it was a hybrid eclipse of the Sun with a magnitude of 1 .
experimental economics is the application of experimental methods to study economic questions .
data collected in experiments are used to estimate effect size , test the validity of economic theories , and illuminate market mechanisms .
economic experiments usually use cash to motivate subjects , in order to mimic real-world incentives .
a fundamental aspect of the subject is design of experiments .
experiments may be conducted in the field or in laboratory settings , whether of individual or group behavior .
variants of the subject outside such formal confines include natural and quasi-natural experiments .
within economics education , one application involves experiments used in the teaching of economics .
in games of two players or more , the subjects often form beliefs about what actions the other subjects are taking and these beliefs are updated over time .
this is known as belief learning .
this is known as reinforcement learning .
until the 1990s , simple adaptive models , such as Cournot competition or fictitious play , were generally used .
in the mid-1990s , Alvin E.
Roth and Ido Erev demonstrated that reinforcement learning can make useful predictions in experimental games .
in 1999 , Colin Camerer and Teck-Hua Ho introduced Experience Weighted Attraction ( EWA ) , a general model that incorporated reinforcement and belief learning , and shows that fictitious play is mathematically equivalent to generalized reinforcement , provided weights are placed on past history .
criticisms of EWA include overfitting due to many parameters , lack of generality over games , and the possibility that the interpretation of EWA parameters may be difficult .
overfitting is addressed by estimating parameters on some of the experimental periods or experimental subjects and forecasting behavior in the remaining sample ( if models are overfitting , these out-of-sample validation forecasts will be much less accurate than in-sample fits , which they generally are not ) .
Roberto Weber has raised issues of learning without feedback .
Charles A.
Holt has studied logit learning in different kinds of games , including games with multiple equilibria .
Wilfred Amaldoss has looked at interesting applications of EWA in marketing .
Amnon Rapoport , Jim Parco and Ryan Murphy have investigated reinforcement-based adaptive learning models in one of the most celebrated paradoxes in game theory known as the centipede game .
Edward Chamberlin is thought to have conducted &quot; not only the first market experiment , but also the first economic experiment of any kind .
&quot; Vernon Smith , drawing on Chamberlin &apos;s work , but also modifying it in key respects , conducted pioneering economics experiments on the convergence of prices and quantities to their theoretical competitive equilibrium values in experimental markets .
Smith studied the behavior of &quot; buyers &quot; and &quot; sellers &quot; , who are told how much they &quot; value &quot; a fictitious commodity and then are asked to competitively &quot; bid &quot; or &quot; ask &quot; on these commodities following the rules of various real world market institutions ( e .
, the Double auction as well the English and Dutch auctions ) .
Smith found that in some forms of centralized trading , prices and quantities traded in such markets converge on the values that would be predicted by the economic theory of perfect competition , despite the conditions not meeting many of the assumptions of perfect competition ( large numbers , perfect information ) .
over the years , Smith pioneered – along with other collaborators – the use of controlled laboratory experiments in economics , and established it as a legitimate tool in economics and other related fields .
Charles Plott of the California Institute of Technology collaborated with Smith in the 1970s and pioneered experiments in political science , as well as using experiments to inform economic design or engineering to inform policies .
in 2002 , Smith was awarded ( jointly with Daniel Kahneman ) the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences &quot; for having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis , especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms &quot; .
experimental finance studies financial markets with the goals of establishing different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and analyze agents &apos; behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows , information diffusion and aggregation , price setting mechanism and returns processes .
presently , researchers use simulation software to conduct their research .
for instance , experiments have manipulated information asymmetry about the holding value of a bond or a share on the pricing for those who don &apos;t have enough information , in order to study stock market bubbles .
agent-based computational modeling is a relatively recent method in economics with experimental dimensions .
the &quot; agent &quot; refers to &quot; computational objects modeled as interacting according to rules , &quot; not real people .
agents can represent social and / or physical entities .
issues include those common to experimental economics in general and by comparison as well as development of a common framework for empirical validation and resolving open questions in agent-based modeling .

political economy originated in moral philosophy .
it was developed in the 18th century as the study of the economies of states , or polities , hence the term political economy .
it is available as an area of study in certain colleges and universities .
exhibitionism is the act of exposing in a public or semi-public context those parts of one &apos;s body that are not normally exposed – for example , the breasts , genitals or buttocks .
the practice may arise from a desire or compulsion to expose themselves in such a manner to groups of friends or acquaintances , or to strangers for their amusement or sexual satisfaction or to shock the bystander .
exposing oneself only to an intimate partner is normally not regarded as exhibitionism .
exhibitionism was first described as a disorder in 1877 by French physician and psychiatrist Charles Lasègue .

excretion is an essential process in all forms of life .
there is no independent experimental evidence for any of these particles .
one example is supersymmetric R-baryons , which are bound states of 3 quarks and a gluino .
the lightest R-baryon is denoted as S0 and consists of an up quark , a down quark , a strange quark and a gluino .
stable exotic baryons are also candidates for strongly interacting dark matter .
non-quark model mesons include .
all of these can be classed as mesons , because they are hadrons and carry zero baryon number .
of these , glueballs must be flavor singlets ; that is , have zero isospin , strangeness , charm , bottomness , and topness .
like all particle states , they are specified by the quantum numbers which label representations of the Poincaré symmetry , q .
, JPC ( where J is the angular momentum , P is the intrinsic parity , and C is the charge conjugation parity ) and by the mass .
one also specifies the isospin I of the meson .
typically , every quark model meson comes in SU ( 3 ) flavor nonet : an octet and a flavor singlet .
a glueball shows up as an extra ( supernumerary ) particle outside the nonet .
in spite of such seemingly simple counting , the assignment of any given state as a glueball , tetraquark , or hybrid remains tentative even today .
even when there is agreement that one of several states is one of these non-quark model mesons , the degree of mixing , and the precise assignment is fraught with uncertainties .
there is also the considerable experimental labor of assigning quantum numbers to each state and crosschecking them in other experiments .
as a result , all assignments outside the quark model are tentative .
the remainder of this article outlines the situation as it stood at the end of 2004 .
lattice QCD predictions for glueballs are now fairly stable , at least when virtual quarks are neglected .
the two lowest states are .
the 0 − + and exotic glueballs such as 0 − − are all expected to lie above 7000200000000000000 ♠ 2 GeV / c2 .
glueballs are necessarily isoscalar , with isospin I = 0 .
the ground state hybrid mesons 0 − + , 1 − + , 1 − − , and 2 − + all lie a little below 7000200000000000000 ♠ 2 GeV / c2 .
the hybrid with exotic quantum numbers 1 − + is at 7000190000000000000 ♠ 1 .
the best lattice computations to date are made in the quenched approximation , which neglects virtual quarks loops .
as a result , these computations miss mixing with meson states .
the data show five isoscalar resonances : f0 ( 500 ) , f0 ( 980 ) , f0 ( 1370 ) , f0 ( 1500 ) , and f0 ( 1710 ) .
of these the f0 ( 500 ) is usually identified with the σ of chiral models .
the decays and production of f0 ( 1710 ) give strong evidence that it is also a meson .
the f0 ( 1370 ) and f0 ( 1500 ) cannot both be a quark model meson , because one is supernumerary .
the production of the higher mass state in two photon reactions such as 2γ → 2π or 2γ → 2K reactions is highly suppressed .
the decays also give some evidence that one of these could be a glueball .
the f0 ( 980 ) has been identified by some authors as a tetraquark meson , along with the I = 1 states a0 ( 980 ) and κ0 ( 800 ) .
two long-lived ( narrow in the jargon of particle spectroscopy ) states : the scalar ( 0 + + ) state D * ± sJ ( 2317 ) and the vector ( 1 + ) meson D * ± sJ ( 2460 ) , observed at CLEO and BaBar , have also been tentatively identified as tetraquark states .
however , for these , other explanations are possible .
two isoscalar states are definitely identified — f2 ( 1270 ) and the f ′ 2 ( 1525 ) .
no other states have been consistently identified by all experiments .
the two isovector exotics π1 ( 1400 ) and π1 ( 1600 ) seem to be well established experimentally .
they are clearly not glueballs , but could be either a tetraquark or a hybrid .
the evidence for such assignments is weak .
the π ( 1800 ) ( 0 − + ) , ρ ( 1900 ) ( 1 − − ) and the η2 ( 1870 ) ( 2 − + ) are fairly well identified states , which have been tentatively identified as hybrids by some authors .
if this identification is correct , then it is a remarkable agreement with lattice computations , which place several hybrids in this range of masses .
the full ionic equation is : .
) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables , and are either solved by hand , or used to create a relevant computer model .
just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional dynamical systems , partial differential equations often model multidimensional systems .
PDEs find their generalisation in stochastic partial differential equations .
if f is a linear function of u and its derivatives , then the PDE is called linear .
common examples of linear PDEs include the heat equation , the wave equation , Laplace &apos;s equation , Helmholtz equation , Klein – Gordon equation , and Poisson &apos;s equation .
a relatively simple PDE is .
this relation implies that the function u ( x , y ) is independent of x .
however , the equation gives no information on the function &apos;s dependence on the variable y .
hence the general solution of this equation is .
where f is an arbitrary function of y .
the analogous ordinary differential equation is .
which has the solution .
where c is any constant value .
these two examples illustrate that general solutions of ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) involve arbitrary constants , but solutions of PDEs involve arbitrary functions .
a solution of a PDE is generally not unique ; additional conditions must generally be specified on the boundary of the region where the solution is defined .
for instance , in the simple example above , the function f ( y ) can be determined if u is specified on the line x = 0 .
although the issue of existence and uniqueness of solutions of ordinary differential equations has a very satisfactory answer with the Picard – Lindelöf theorem , that is far from the case for partial differential equations .
the Cauchy – Kowalevski theorem states that the Cauchy problem for any partial differential equation whose coefficients are analytic in the unknown function and its derivatives , has a locally unique analytic solution .
although this result might appear to settle the existence and uniqueness of solutions , there are examples of linear partial differential equations whose coefficients have derivatives of all orders ( which are nevertheless not analytic ) but which have no solutions at all : see Lewy ( 1957 ) .
even if the solution of a partial differential equation exists and is unique , it may nevertheless have undesirable properties .
the mathematical study of these questions is usually in the more powerful context of weak solutions .
an example of pathological behavior is the sequence ( depending upon n ) of Cauchy problems for the Laplace equation .
with boundary conditions .
where n is an integer .
the derivative of u with respect to y approaches 0 uniformly in x as n increases , but the solution is .
this solution approaches infinity if nx is not an integer multiple of π for any non-zero value of y .
the Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation is called ill-posed or not well-posed , since the solution does not continuously depend on the data of the problem .
especially in physics , del or Nabla ( ∇ ) is often used to denote spatial derivatives , and u ˙ u ¨ { \ displaystyle { \ dot { u } } \ , { \ ddot { u } } \ , } for time derivatives .
where Δ is the Laplace operator .
in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics , one may consider the quantum Hamilton &apos;s equations for trajectories of quantum particles .
these equations are infinite-order PDEs .
separable PDEs correspond to diagonal matrices – thinking of &quot; the value for fixed x &quot; as a coordinate , each coordinate can be understood separately .
this generalizes to the method of characteristics , and is also used in integral transforms .
this corresponds to diagonalizing an operator .
an important example of this is Fourier analysis , which diagonalizes the heat equation using the eigenbasis of sinusoidal waves .
if the domain is finite or periodic , an infinite sum of solutions such as a Fourier series is appropriate , but an integral of solutions such as a Fourier integral is generally required for infinite domains .
the solution for a point source for the heat equation given above is an example of the use of a Fourier integral .
often a PDE can be reduced to a simpler form with a known solution by a suitable change of variables .
for example , the Black – Scholes PDE .
is reducible to the heat equation .
by the change of variables ( for complete details see Solution of the Black Scholes Equation at the Wayback Machine ( archived April 11 , 2008 ) ) .
the FEM has a prominent position among these methods and especially its exceptionally efficient higher-order version hp-FEM .

in Greek mythology , Erato / ˈɛrətoʊ / ( Ancient Greek : Ἐρατώ ) is one of the Greek Muses .
the name would mean &quot; desired &quot; or &quot; lovely &quot; , if derived from the same root as Eros , as Apollonius of Rhodes playfully suggested in the invocation to Erato that begins Book III of his Argonautica .
Erato is the Muse of lyric poetry .
in the Orphic hymn to the Muses , it is Erato who charms the sight .
since the Renaissance she has mostly been shown with a wreath of myrtle and roses , holding a lyre , or a small kithara , a musical instrument often associated with Apollo .
in Simon Vouet &apos;s representations , two turtle-doves are eating seeds at her feet .
other representations may show her holding a golden arrow , reminding one of the &quot; eros &quot; , the feeling that she inspires in everybody , and at times she is accompanied by the god Eros , holding a torch .
Erato was named with the other muses in Hesiod &apos;s Theogony .
she was also invoked at the beginning of a lost poem , Rhadine ( Ῥαδινή ) , that was referred to and briefly quoted by Strabo .
the love story of Rhadine made her supposed tomb on the island of Samos a pilgrimage site for star-crossed lovers in the time of Pausanias and Erato was linked again with love in Plato &apos;s Phaedrus ; nevertheless , even in the third century BC , when Apollonius wrote , the Muses were not yet as inextricably linked to specific types of poetry as they became .
Erato is also invoked at the start of book 7 of Virgil &apos;s Aeneid , which marks the beginning of the second half or &apos; Iliadic &apos; section of the poem : Calliope ( epic ) , even Melpomene ( tragedy ) or Clio ( history ) might seem more appropriate .
this choice may express Virgil &apos;s love for his native land , but in any case shows the need for a new creative force at this change in the direction of the poem .
Ercole Antonio Mattioli ( 1 December 1640 – 1694 ) was an Italian politician , who was a minister of Duke Charles IV of Mantua .
he was kidnapped and imprisoned by Louis XIV of France .
he has been associated with the Man in the Iron Mask .
Mattioli was born at Valenza , in what is now the province of Alessandria .
he worked as a minister of Charles IV , Duke of Mantua , who , as Marquess of Montferrat , possessed the strategic fortress of Casale Monferrato .
Louis XIV wanted the fortress and was willing to purchase it for 100,000 crowns .
since a French occupation would be unpopular , secrecy was needed until the deal was finalised .
Mattioli successfully negotiated the trade and in gratitude , Louis XIV rewarded him lavishly .
however , when the French were about to occupy the castle , Mattioli revealed the secret deal to the governments of Austria , Savoy , Spain and Venice , possibly for additional rewards .
Louis XIV had to cancel the deal and withdraw though he eventually took control of Casale two years later .
by 1680 he was described as nearly mad .
his manservant was also kidnapped and held with him .
Ercole Antonio Mattioli died in 1694 while incarcerated on the island of Sainte-Marguerite .
another prisoner at Pignerol was Eustache Dauger , the so-called Man in the Iron Mask , which some have said was actually made of black velvet cloth .
Dauger was in the custody of a man named Saint-Mars and was held in the prisons of which Saint-Mars was governor .
it has been suggested that Mattioli himself was the masked prisoner and this was a popular theory during much of the 19th-century .
since the prisoner is known to have been buried under the name &quot; Marchioly &quot; , many believe that this is proof enough that he was the man in the mask .
but letters sent by Saint-Mars indicate that he was only held at Pignerol and Sainte-Marguerite .
he was never at the Bastille and can therefore be discounted .

an important branch of stereochemistry is the study of chiral molecules .
stereochemistry includes methods for determining and describing these relationships ; the effect on the physical or biological properties these relationships impart upon the molecules in question , and the manner in which these relationships influence the reactivity of the molecules in question ( dynamic stereochemistry ) .
Louis Pasteur could rightly be described as the first stereochemist , having observed in 1849 that salts of tartaric acid collected from wine production vessels could rotate plane polarized light , but that salts from other sources did not .
this property , the only physical property in which the two types of tartrate salts differed , is due to optical isomerism .
in 1874 , Jacobus Henricus van &apos; t Hoff and Joseph Le Bel explained optical activity in terms of the tetrahedral arrangement of the atoms bound to carbon .
Cahn – Ingold – Prelog priority rules are part of a system for describing a molecule &apos;s stereochemistry .

it is the combination between ethnology and linguistics .
in some parts of the world ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and pedagogical doctrine , with cultural anthropology becoming dominant especially in the United States , and social anthropology in Great Britain .
the distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry .
ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups .
the 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occidental , such as , the notion of the &quot; Other &quot; .
this term was used in conjunction with &quot; savages &quot; , which was either seen as a brutal barbarian , or alternatively , as &quot; noble savage &quot; .
thus , civilization was opposed in a dualist manner to barbary , a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared ethnocentrism .
the progress of ethnology , for example with Claude Lévi-Strauss &apos;s structural anthropology , led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear progress , or the pseudo-opposition between &quot; societies with histories &quot; and &quot; societies without histories &quot; , judged too dependent on a limited view of history as constituted by accumulative growth .
Lévi-Strauss often referred to Montaigne &apos;s essay on cannibalism as an early example of ethnology .
Lévi-Strauss aimed , through a structural method , at discovering universal invariants in human society , chief among which he believed to be the incest taboo .
however , the claims of such cultural universalism have been criticized by various 19th and 20th century social thinkers , including Marx , Nietzsche , Foucault , Derrida , Althusser and Deleuze .
the French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline since the early 1950s with Paul Rivet , Marcel Griaule , Germaine Dieterlen , Claude Lévi-Strauss and Jean Rouch .

Vanda sanderiana is a flower of the orchid family .
it is commonly called Waling-waling in the Philippines and is also called Sander &apos;s Vanda , after Henry Frederick Conrad Sander , a noted orchidologist .
the orchid is considered to be the &quot; Queen of Philippine flowers &quot; and is worshiped as a diwata by the indigenous Bagobo people .
Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach named as Vanda sanderiana .
Rudolf Schlechter separated Euanthe from Vanda in 1914 due to structural differences in the flowers .
( lact of spur ) For breeding purposes and registration by the Royal Horticultural Society , however , it is still treated as a Vanda .
Vanda sanderiana is endemic to Mindanao in the provinces of Davao , Cotabato , and Zamboanga where it is found on the trunks of dipterocarp trees at elevations below 500 meters .
Over-collected , the plant is considered rare in nature .
it is often used in hybridization .
the term &quot; Euarchonta &quot; ( meaning &quot; true ancestors &quot; ) first appeared in the general scientific literature in 1999 , when molecular evidence suggested that the morphology-based Archonta should be trimmed down to exclude Chiroptera .
major DNA sequence analyses of predominantly nuclear sequences ( Murphy et al .
, 2001 ) support the Euarchonta hypothesis , while a major study investigating mitochondrial sequences supports a different tree topology ( Arnason et al .
, 2002 ) .
a study investigating retrotransposon presence / absence data has claimed strong support for Euarchonta ( Kriegs et al .
, 2007 ) .

the eudicots , Eudicotidae or eudicotyledons are a monophyletic clade of flowering plants that had been called tricolpates or non-magnoliid dicots by previous authors .
the botanical terms were introduced in 1991 by evolutionary botanist James A.
Doyle and paleobotanist Carol L.
Hotton to emphasize the later evolutionary divergence of tricolpate dicots from earlier , less specialized , dicots .
the other name for the eudicots is tricolpates , a name which refers to the grooved structure of the pollen .
members of the group have tricolpate pollen , or forms derived from it .
some common and familiar eudicots include members of the sunflower family such as the common dandelion , the forget-me-not , cabbage and other members of its family , apple , buttercup , maple , and macadamia .
the name &quot; eudicots &quot; ( plural ) is used in the APG system , of 1998 , and APG II system , of 2003 , for classification of angiosperms .

Eupodophis is an extinct genus of snake from the Late Cretaceous period .
it has two small hind legs and is considered a transitional form between Cretaceous lizards and limbless snakes .
the feature , described as vestigial , was most likely useless to Eupodophis .
the type species Eupodophis descouensi was named in 2000 .
the specific name is dedicated to the French naturalist Didier Descouens .
the fossilized specimen from which the description of the type species was based was 85 cm ( 33 .
5 in ) long and is approximately 92 million years old .
it was found in Cenomanian-age limestone near the al-Nammoura village in Lebanon .
tarsal bones are present but reduced in size and form .
the metatarsals and phalanges of the foot are absent .
8 inches long , with an &quot; unmistakable &quot; fibula , tibia and femur .
this lightness is also seen in the bones of terrestrial lizards , suggesting that the limbs had not been part of the overall adaptation of the skeleton for an aquatic lifestyle .
the loss of limbs in Eupodophis may have been the result of changes in Hox genes , genes that specify the development specific regions of the body .
because Hox genes are involved in determining specific features of the axial skeleton , the loss of limbs would also result in the loss of cervical ( tail ) vertebrae that are near them .
this loss is seen in Eupodophis and modern snakes but not legless lizards , which may be far less common because some other factor besides Hox genes were involved in the loss of their limbs .
the loss of digits on the hind limbs may be explained by a low number of cells in the limb bud during embryonic development .
the loss of forelimbs and reduction of hind limbs in Eupodophis was likely an adaptation for swimming .
while living snakes usually employ undulatory movement for moving over land , sinuous movements are also an effective means of moving through water .
it is found on Borneo .
at the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Paetus and Pennus ( or , less frequently , year 587 Ab urbe condita ) .

the Gateway Protection Programme is a scheme operated by the British government in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) and co-funded by the European Union ( EU ) , offering a legal route for a quota of UNHCR-identified refugees to be resettled in the United Kingdom .
following a proposal by the British Home Secretary , David Blunkett , in October 2001 , the legal basis was established by the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the programme itself launched in March 2004 .
since its inception , the programme has enjoyed broad support from the UK &apos;s main political parties .
the Gateway Protection Programme initially had a quota of 500 refugees per year , which was later increased to 750 , but the actual number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted .
Liberian , Congolese , Sudanese , Burmese , Ethiopian , Mauritanian , Iraqi , Bhutanese , Eritrean , Palestinian , Sierra Leonean and Somali refugees have been resettled under the programme .
refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland .
of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012 , eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside .
evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities , but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment .
the programme is the UK &apos;s &quot; quota refugee &quot; resettlement scheme .
refugees designated as particularly vulnerable by the UNHCR are assessed by the Home Office for eligibility under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees .
if they meet the eligibility criteria they are then brought to the UK and granted indefinite leave to remain .
the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) helps facilitate pre-departure medical screening , counselling , dossier preparation , transport and immediate arrival assistance .
once in the UK , refugees are entered into a 12-month support programme intended to aid their integration .
the programme has involved local authorities and NGOs including the British Red Cross , the International Rescue Committee , Migrant Helpline , Refugee Action , the Refugee Arrivals Project , the Refugee Council , Scottish Refugee Council and Refugee Support .
these organisations formed the Resettlement Inter-Agency Partnership at the planning stage of the programme , in order to pool their resources and form a partnership for the delivery of services to the resettled refugees .
the programme is distinct from and in addition to ordinary provisions for claiming asylum in the United Kingdom .
since 2008 , it has been co-funded by the European Union , first through the European Refugee Fund and then through its successor , the Asylum , Migration and Integration Fund ( AMIF ) .
over the period 2009 – 14 , the Home Office provided £ 29 .
Anna Musgrave of the Refugee Council argues that the programme &quot; is rarely talked about and the Home Office , in the main , stay fairly quiet about it .
the Gateway Protection Programme is not the first British refugee resettlement programme .
other , informal resettlement programmes include the Mandate Refugee Scheme , and the UK has also participated in the Ten or More Plan .
the former is for so-called &quot; mandate &quot; refugees who have been granted refugee status by UNHCR in third countries .
to qualify for the scheme , refugees must have close ties to the UK and it must also be demonstrated that the UK is the most appropriate country for their resettlement .
the Ten or More Plan , established by UNHCR in 1973 and administered in the UK by the British Red Cross , is for refugees requiring medical attention not available in their current location .
during the 1990s , 2,620 refugees were settled in the UK through these two programmes .
in 2003 , the UK &apos;s Ten or More Plan had a resettlement goal of 10 people and the Mandate Refugee Scheme 300 .
refugees have also been resettled through specific programmes following emergencies .
for example , 42,000 Ugandan Asians expelled from Uganda during 1972 – 74 , 22,500 Vietnamese during 1979 – 92 , over 2,500 Bosnians in the 1990s , and over 4,000 Kosovars in 1999 .
a new resettlement programme was proposed by the British Home Secretary , David Blunkett in October 2001 , having been hinted at by the previous Home Secretary , Jack Straw , in a speech to the European Conference on Asylum in Lisbon in June 2000 .
the legal basis for the programme &apos;s funding was established by Section 59 of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 .
this act was passed by the House of Commons by 362 votes to 74 in June 2002 and by the House of Lords – at the ninth attempt , following concern about the introduction of measures allowing for the detention of asylum seekers in rural areas ) – in November 2002 .
the Gateway Protection Programme was subsequently established in March 2004 , with the first refugees arriving in the UK on 19 March .
initially , the programme quota was set at 500 per year .
the British government has faced criticism from academics and practitioners over the small number of refugees it has resettled in comparison with other developed states .
for example , in 2001 the countries with the largest quota schemes were the United States ( 80,000 refugees ) , Canada ( 11,000 ) and Australia ( 10,000 ) .
initially , David Blunkett had intended to raise the quota to 1,000 in the second year of the programme &apos;s operation , but local councils &apos; reluctance to participate in the scheme meant that it was slow to take off .
the quota remained at 500 per year until the 2008 / 09 financial year , when it was increased to 750 refugees per year .
the number of refugees resettled under the scheme is small in comparison to the number of asylum seekers offered protection in the UK .
for example , in 2013 , 17,647 initial decisions on asylum claims were made by the Home Office , of which 5,734 ( 32 .
5 per cent ) determined the applicant to be a refugee and granted them asylum , 53 ( 0 .
3 per cent ) granted humanitarian protection and 540 ( 3 .
1 per cent ) granted discretionary leave .
11,105 applications ( 62 .
9 per cent ) were refused .
2 million forcibly displaced people at the end of 2013 , 16 .
7 million of whom were refugees .
the programme has been supported by the main British political parties at the national level since its inception , and there has also been support from councillors from each of the main parties at the local authority level .
on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the scheme in 2014 , refugee groups and others praised it as a successful programme and called for it to be expanded , particularly in light of the Syrian refugee crisis .
in early 2014 , Amnesty International and the Refugee Council campaigned for the government to offer resettlement or humanitarian protection to Syrian refugees above and beyond the Gateway quota of 750 per year , &quot; to ensure that resettlement opportunities continue to be available to refugees from the rest of the world &quot; .
the anniversary of the programme was also the occasion of further criticism of the 750 quota , with some commentators arguing that this is mean-spirited and continues to compare unfavourably with the refugee resettlement programmes of states including the United States , Canada and Australia .
others , such as academic Jonathan Darling , have been more skeptical about expanding the scheme , for fear that any such move will be accompanied by greater restrictions on the ability of people to claim asylum in the UK .
he argues that &quot; we must be critical of any attempts to expand such a quota-based scheme at the expense of a more progressive asylum system &quot; .
furthermore , he argues that the &quot; hospitality &quot; of the scheme is highly conditional and can be viewed as a form of &quot; compassionate repression &quot; , with the UNHCR , the Home Office and local authorities all involved in &quot; sorting , decision , and consideration over which individuals are the &apos; exceptional cases &apos; &quot; , to the exclusion of others .
in September 2015 , in the context of the European migrant crisis , Labour Party leadership candidate Yvette Cooper called for an increase in the number of refugees resettled in the UK to 10,000 .
the prime minister , David Cameron , subsequently announced that the UK would resettle 20,000 refugees from camps in countries bordering Syria over the period to 2020 under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme , which was established in early 2014 and is distinct from , but modelled on , the Gateway Protection Programme .
the number of refugees resettled under the programme has been below the quota in every year except for 2009 , 2012 and 2013 .
refugees resettled have included Liberians from Guinea and Sierra Leone , Congolese ( DRC ) from Uganda and Zambia , Sudanese from Uganda , Burmese ( including Karen , Mon , Pa &apos;O and Rohingya people ) from Thailand , Ethiopians from Kenya , and Mauritanians from Senegal .
provision was made for 1,000 Iraqi refugees to be resettled in the UK between 1 April 2008 and the end of March 2010 .
in 2008 , 236 Iraqis were resettled and as of 18 May , a further 212 had been resettled in 2009 .
however , in May 2009 the programme was shut down for those Iraqis resettling due to having worked in support of British occupying forces and therefore at risk for reprisals .
this decision was criticised as premature and &quot; mean-spirited &quot; by some members of Parliament .
nonetheless , other Iraqis continue to be resettled under the Gateway Protection Programme and between 2004 and 2015 , a total of 1,446 Iraqis were resettled as part of the programme .
other nationalities of refugees resettled under the scheme include Bhutanese , Eritreans , Palestinians , Sierra Leoneans and Somalis .
in March 2009 , out of the 434 local authorities in the UK , 15 were participating in the programme .
by 2012 , a total of 18 local authorities had participated .
in a review of the scheme , academics Duncan Sim and Kait Laughlin note that &quot; it is clear that , as with asylum seekers dispersed by the UK Borders Agency under Home Office dispersal policy , most refugees have been resettled away from London and south east England , a policy which may lead to separation of extended families &quot; .
of the 18 local authorities , eight are in North West England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside .
the first refugees resettled under the programme were housed in Sheffield , which was the first city to join the scheme and which had branded itself the UK &apos;s first &apos; City of Sanctuary &apos; .
others have been housed in cities and towns including Bradford , Brighton and Hove , Bromley , Colchester , Hull , Middlesbrough , Motherwell , Norwich , and the Manchester area including Bolton , Bury , Oldham , Rochdale , Salford , Stockport and Tameside .
Sheffield , Bolton and Hull have received the largest numbers , accounting for just under half of all refugees resettled under the programme between 2004 and 2012 .
the large proportion of refugees who have been resettled in North West England has been attributed partly to strong leadership on migration issues in Greater Manchester .
in 2007 , North Lanarkshire Council won the &quot; Creating Integrated Communities &quot; category in the UK Housing Awards for its involvement in the Gateway Protection Programme .
research with Congolese refugees settled with North Lanarkshire Council in Motherwell has found that the majority want to stay in the town and that they view it positively both as a location in its own right , and in comparison with other resettlement locations .
in April 2007 , Bolton Museum held an exhibition of photos of Sudanese refugees resettled in the town under the programme .
a film , titled Moving to Mars was made about two ethnic Karen families resettled from Burma to Sheffield under the Gateway Protection Programme .
the film opened the Sheffield International Documentary Festival in November 2009 and was aired on the television channel More4 on 2 February 2010 .
on 17 July 2009 , three Congolese men resettled in Norwich under the programme were killed in a car crash on the A1 road .
the Home Office released a promotional video in October 2009 that highlighted the success of the programme in resettling the first 15 Congolese families in Norwich in 2006 .
in 2011 , the Home Office stopped using Norwich as a resettlement location in favour of locations in Yorkshire and Lancashire , reportedly to the disappointment of the local council .
resettlement has been presented as a means of the UK fulfilling its obligations towards displaced people in the context of hostile public attitudes towards asylum seekers .
research has shown that members of the British public are generally well disposed to providing protection to genuine refugees , but are sceptical about the validity of asylum seekers &apos; claims .
a report published in 2005 states that &quot; some participating agencies have been reluctant to pursue a proactive media strategy due to local political considerations and issues relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers &quot; .
however , in February 2006 , the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department Andy Burnham , when asked about how the programme fitted in with community cohesion strategies , stated in the House of Commons that : .
&quot; the early evidence from areas in which authorities have participated in the programme shows that it has been successful in challenging some of the attacks on the notion of political asylum that we have heard in recent years .
in Bolton and Sheffield in particular , the towns have rallied around the individuals who have come to them .
the programme has been a positive experience for the receiving community and , of course , for the vulnerable individuals who have benefited from the protection that those towns have offered &quot; .
a report into the experience of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the University of Sussex in December 2007 .
the report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills .
another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment , noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs .
in February 2009 , the Home Office published a report evaluating the effectiveness of the Gateway Protection Programme .
the research it was based upon focused on refugees &apos; integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement .
the research found that refugees showed signs of integration , including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship .
the report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns .
younger refugees and children had made the most progress .
no specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme .
instead , Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages ( ESOL ) courses , which are run by a range of state , voluntary and community-based organisations .
however , the International Catholic Migration Commission ( ICMC ) Europe reports that in Sheffield , it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme &apos;s operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013 .
the Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment , but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills .
the majority of women were not in work , reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision .
a number of programme evaluations have found that many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK .
the Home Office &apos;s 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment .
an evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation ( who had been in the UK for a year ) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK , and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement .
many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities , and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers , who generally suggested that community relations were good .
verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation .

in supersymmetry , a gluino ( symbol g͂ ) is the hypothetical supersymmetric partner of a gluon .
should they exist , gluinos are expected by supersymmetry theorists to be pair produced in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider .
in supersymmetric theories , gluinos are Majorana fermions and interact via the strong force as a color octet .
gluinos have a lepton number 0 , baryon number 0 , and spin 1 / 2 .
in models of supersymmetry that conserve R-parity , gluinos decay via the strong interaction to a squark and a quark , provided that an appropriate mass relation is satisfied .
the squark subsequently decays to another quark and the lightest supersymmetric particle , LSP ( which leaves the detector unseen ) .
this means that a typical signal for a gluino at a hadron collider would be four jets plus missing energy .
however if gluinos are lighter than squarks , 3-body decay of a gluino to a neutralino and a quark antiquark pair is kinematically accessible through an off-shell squark .

the Teacher of Righteousness ( in Hebrew : מורה הצדק Moreh ha-Tzedek ) is a figure found in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran , most prominently in the Damascus Document .
the Teacher is extolled as having proper understanding of the Torah , qualified in its accurate instruction , and being the one through whom God would reveal to the community “ the hidden things in which Israel had gone astray ” .
although the exact identity of the Teacher is unknown , based on the text of the Community Rule scroll , the teachers of the sect are identified as Kohens ( priests ) of patrilineal progeny of Zadok ( the first high priest to serve in The First Temple ) , leading scholars to assume the Teacher as a Kohen ( priest ) of Tzadokite lineage &#91; citation needed &#93; .
one theory initially advocated by Jerome Murphy-O &apos;Connor and subsequently by Stegemann is that the Teacher of Righteousness served as High Priest but was subsequently ousted by Jonathan Maccabeus .
in 1 Maccabees , no High Priest is named for the period from the death of Alcimus in 159 BCE to the claiming of the position of High Priest by Jonathan on the authority of Alexander Balas in 152 BCE ( 1 Macc 10 : 18-20 ) .
from this it could be concluded that there was no High Priest for these years , and indeed Josephus , drawing heavily on I Maccabees at this point in his history , comes to that conclusion ( Ant .
it is improbable , however , that the office remained completely vacant for these years .
Stegemann suggests that the reason that nothing is said in 1 Maccabees about a High Priest between Alcimus and Jonathan was apologetic : to conceal the fact that the Hasmoneans obtained the High Priesthood by usurping it from its rightful holder , the Teacher of Righteousness .
Alvar Ellegård follows this line and argues that the Teacher of Righteousness was not only the leader of the Essenes at Qumran , but was also identical to the original Jesus about 150 years before the time of the Gospels .
critics of this theory accuse it of being too hypothetical : slotting the Teacher as High Priest into a convenient gap during which no other High Priest is recorded in the few sources we have .
not the Damascus Document , nor 1QS or 4QMMT suggest that the legitimacy of the High Priest was an issue for the split .
in addition , the motivation behind the split of the sect from mainstream Judaism appears to have been of a religious rather than political nature .
Michael O.
wise posits that the Teacher of Righteousness was the &quot; first messiah &quot; , a figure predating Jesus by roughly 100 years .
this figure - who Wise believes was named Judah - rose to prominence during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus , and had been a priest and confidant to the king .
however , he became dissatisfied with the religious sects in Jerusalem , and in reaction , founded a &quot; crisis cult &quot; .
while amassing a following , the Teacher ( and his followers ) claimed he was the fulfillment of various Biblical prophecies , with an emphasis on those found in Isaiah .
the Teacher was eventually killed by the religious leadership in Jerusalem , and his followers hailed him as messianic figure who had been exalted to the presence of God &apos;s throne .
they then anticipated that the Teacher would return to judge the wicked and lead the righteous into a golden age , and that it would take place within the next forty years .
wise explains that dating of manuscript copies among the Dead Sea Scrolls shows that the Teacher &apos;s postmortem following drastically increased in size over several years , but that when the predicted return and golden age failed to materialize , his following dissipated rapidly .
&quot; Zadok &quot; in Hebrew ( צדוק ) translates as &quot; righteous .
Robert Eisenman has proposed James , brother of Jesus as the Teacher against a &quot; Wicked Priest &quot; ( Ananus ben Ananus ) , and a &quot; Spouter of Lies &quot; which Eisenman identifies as Paul of Tarsus .
however , the introduction of the Teacher of Righteousness in the Damascus Document ( CD 1 : 5-11 ) places the ascendance of this figure just prior to the outbreak of the Maccabean revolt sometime in the first half of the second century BCE .
that date is roughly two hundred years too early to be James , the brother of Jesus .
Stephen Goranson suggests that Judah the Essene , mentioned by Josephus , is the Teacher .

Gwanghwamun ( Hangul : 광화문 ; Hanja : 光化門 ) is the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace , in Jongno-gu , Seoul , South Korea .
it is located at a three-way intersection at the northern end of Sejongno .
as a landmark and symbol of Seoul &apos;s long history as the capital city during the Joseon Dynasty , the gate has gone through multiple periods of destruction and disrepair .
restoration work on the gate was finished and it was opened to the public on August 15 , 2010 .
Gwanghwamun was first constructed in 1395 as the main gate to Gyeongbokgung Palace , the main and most important royal palace during the Joseon Dynasty .
during the 1592 Japanese invasion , it was destroyed by fire and left in ruins for over 250 years .
Gwanghwamun was reconstructed in 1867 along with the rest of Gyeongbokgung Palace by the order of regent Daewongun during the reign of Emperor Gojong .
the gate stood until 1926 , when the Japanese government had it deconstructed and moved it just to the southeast of the current location of the National Folk Museum of Korea to make way for the massive Japanese Governor General Building .
the Korean War completely destroyed the wooden structure of Gwanghwamun , and its stone base lay in complete disrepair and neglect .
in 1968 , during Park Chung-hee &apos;s administration , the stone base was again relocated in front of the Japanese Governor General Building .
Gwanghwamun remained as a concrete gate until late 2006 .
Gwanghwamun underwent a major restoration project since December 2006 and was finished in August 2010 .
the gate was disassembled and moved back to its original location 14 .
Gwanghwamun was opened to the public on August 15 , 2010 , to commemorate Gwangbokjeol , or Liberation Day of Korea .
the project cost ₩ 28 billion .

the Gwiyomi Song , or Kwiyomi Song ( 귀요미 송 ) , is a K-pop single by South Korean singer Hari and was released on February 18 , 2013 .
it was inspired by a gesture from South Korean rapper Jung Ilhoon of boy group BtoB .
this video has since inspired many Asian netizens to upload their own versions onto the internet .
he made the gestures during episode 24 of BtoB &apos;s reality TV show called MTV Diary , which aired in 2012 .
the gesture became popular among various Korean entertainers after Ilhoon made an appearance on South Korean variety show Weekly Idol .
the show then featured a mini segment dubbed &quot; The Aegyo Battle &quot; ( Battle of Cuteness ) where various idols performed different variations of the Gwiyomi gesture .
on February 18 , 2013 , a song called the &quot; Gwiyomi song &quot; was released by South Korean singer Hari .
the song was inspired by Jung Ilhoon &apos;s &apos; Gwiyeomi Player &apos; .
according to The Bangkok Post , &quot; Gwiyomi &quot; or &quot; Kiyomi &quot; is Korean slang used to refer to a cute person .
the lyrics of the song can be interpreted as &quot; 1 + 1 = Cutie , 2 + 2 = Cutie &quot; , etc .
Gwiyeo captures the meaning of cuteness , and &quot; -un &quot; is a form of conjugation to be altered for each intended usage .
the &quot; Gwiyomi Player &quot; was mostly recreated by teenage girls from Southeast Asia , where the K-pop music genre has a huge and loyal fanbase especially in Thailand and in the Philippines .
a few Thai actresses including Nuengthida Sophon also performed their own version of Gwiyomi .
on March 26 , The Bangkok Post described the &quot; Gwiyomi &quot; song as the latest web-viral sensation that has unseated &quot; Gangnam Style &quot; to become the new K-pop craze .
in early April 2013 , the China Internet Information Center ( a web portal operating under the auspices of the Chinese State Council Information Office ) reported that large numbers of Chinese Internet users have uploaded their own version of the &quot; Gwiyomi &quot; song .
the Gwiyomi phenomenon began trending in several other countries in the region , including Malaysia , Singapore , Hong Kong and Taiwan .

he was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities , and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate , the Roman prefect .
in John , the disciple Philip refers to him as &quot; Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth &quot; ( John 1 : 45 ) .
the name Jesus is derived from the Latin Iesus , a transliteration of the Greek Ἰησοῦς ( Iesous ) .
common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression .
this provokes Caiaphas to tear his own robe in anger and to accuse Jesus of blasphemy .
Sanders , Géza Vermes , Gerd Theissen , Christoph Burchard , and John Dominic Crossan .
Jesus is called the &quot; Spirit of God &quot; because he was born through the action of the Spirit , but that belief does not imply his pre-existence .
to aid in his ministry to the Jewish people , Jesus was given the ability to perform miracles , by permission of God rather than by his own power .
through his ministry , Jesus is seen as a precursor to Muhammad .
according to the Quran , Jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah , who physically raised Jesus into the heavens .
the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has several distinct teachings about Jesus .
Ahmadis believe that he was a mortal man who survived his crucifixion and died a natural death at the age of 120 in Kashmir , India and is buried at Roza Bal .
Bahá &apos;í teachings consider Jesus to be a manifestation of God , a Bahá &apos;í concept for prophets — intermediaries between God and humanity , serving as messengers and reflecting God &apos;s qualities and attributes .
thereafter , despite the lack of biblical references or historical records , a wide range of depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia , often influenced by cultural settings , political circumstances and theological contexts .

Hiero II ( Greek : Ἱέρων Β ΄ ; c .
he strengthened his position by marrying the daughter of Leptines , the leading citizen .
in the meantime , the Mamertines , a body of Campanian mercenaries who had been employed by Agathocles , had seized the stronghold of Messana , and proceeded in harassing the Syracusans .
they were finally defeated in a pitched battle near Mylae along the Longanus river by Hiero , who was only prevented from capturing Messana by Carthaginian interference .
his grateful countrymen then made him king ( 270 ) .
in 264 BC he again returned to the attack , and the Mamertines called in the aid of Rome .
Hiero at once joined the Punic leader Hanno , who had recently landed in Sicily ; but fighting a battle to an inconclusive outcome with the Romans led by the consul Appius Claudius Caudex , he withdrew to Syracuse .
pressed by the Roman forces , in 263 he concluded a treaty with Rome , by which he was to rule over the south-east of Sicily and the eastern coast as far as Tauromenium .
from this time until his death in 215 BC he remained loyal to the Romans , and frequently assisted them with men and provisions during the Punic war .
he kept up a powerful fleet for defensive purposes , and employed his famous kinsman Archimedes in the construction of those engines that , at a later date , played so important a part during the siege of Syracuse by the Romans .
according to a story told by Vitruvius , Hiero suspected he was being cheated by the goldsmith to whom he had supplied the gold to make a votive crown for a temple .
he asked Archimedes to find out if all the gold had been used , as had been agreed .
Hieron I ( Greek : Ἱέρων Α ΄ ; usually Latinized Hiero ) was the son of Deinomenes , the brother of Gelon and tyrant of Syracuse in Sicily from 478 to 467 BC .
in succeeding Gelon , he conspired against a third brother , Polyzelos .
during his reign , he greatly increased the power of Syracuse .
he removed the inhabitants of Naxos and Catana to Leontini , peopled Catana ( which he renamed Aetna ) with Dorians , concluded an alliance with Acragas ( Agrigentum ) and espoused the cause of the Locrians against Anaxilas , tyrant of Rhegium .
his most important military achievement was the defeat of the Etruscans and Carthaginians at the Battle of Cumae ( 474 BC ) , by which he saved the Greeks of Campania from Etruscan domination .
a bronze helmet ( now in the British Museum ) , with an inscription commemorating the event , was dedicated at Olympia .
Hieron &apos;s reign was marked by the creation of the believed first secret police in Greek history , and he was a liberal patron of literature and culture .
the poets Simonides , Pindar , Bacchylides , Aeschylus , and Epicharmus were active at his court , as well the philosopher Xenophanes .
he was an active participant in panhellenic athletic contests , winning several victories in the single horse race and also in the chariot race .
he won the chariot race at Delphi in 470 ( a victory celebrated in Pindar &apos;s first Pythian ode ) and at Olympia in 468 ( this , his greatest victory , was commemorated in Bacchylides &apos; third victory ode ) .
other odes dedicated to him include Pindar &apos;s first Olympian Ode , his second and third Pythian odes , and Bacchylides &apos; fourth and fifth victory odes .
he died at Catana / Aetna in 467 and was buried there , but his grave was later destroyed when the former inhabitants of Catana returned to the city .
the tyranny at Syracuse lasted only a year or so after his death .

the Miracle on the Han River refers to the period of rapid economic growth in South Korea following the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) , during which South Korea transformed from a developing country to a developed country .
this analogy was incorporated by Chang Myon , prime minister of the Second Republic of Korea , in his New Year &apos;s address of 1961 , in which he encouraged South Koreans to bear difficulties in the hope of achieving a similar economic upturn .
the resultant growth has been attributed to the hard work of the labour force , in terms of which the phrase &apos;s use of &quot; miracle &quot; may be seen as a misnomer .
the Second Republic of South Korea existed for only one year , but had a great effect on economy and history of South Korea through ideology and policy .
Prime Minister Chang Myon and the Democratic Party held a stance of extreme anti-communism ( as did the First Republic ) , but also advocated an Economic First Policy with State-led Capitalism , promoting amity and economic cooperation with Japan .
when a military coup in 1961 led by general Park Chung-hee overthrew the Democratic Party , the result was a military junta under the SCNR .

let the moon with soft , gentle light me descry , Let the dawn send forth its fleeting , brilliant light , In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh , And should a bird descend on my cross and alight , Let the bird intone a song of peace o &apos;er my site .
let the burning sun the raindrops vaporize And with my clamor behind return pure to the sky ; Let a friend shed tears over my early demise ; And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high , Pray too , oh , my Motherland , that in God may rest I.
pray thee for all the hapless who have died , For all those who unequalled torments have undergone ; For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried ; For orphans , widows and captives to tortures were shied , And pray too that you may see your own redemption .
and when the dark night wraps the cemet &apos;ry And only the dead to vigil there are left alone , Don &apos;t disturb their repose , disturb not the mystery : if thou hear the sounds of cithern or psaltery , It is I , dear Country , who , a song t &apos;you intone .
and when my grave by all is no more remembered , With neither cross nor stone to mark its place , Let it be plowed by man , with spade let it be scattered And my ashes ere to nothingness are restored , Let them turn to dust to cover thy earthly space .
farewell , parents , brothers , beloved by me , Friends of my childhood , in the home distressed ; Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day ; Farewell , sweet stranger , my friend , who brightened my way ; Farewell to all I love ; to die is to rest .

the impeachment trial was formally opened on November 20 , with twenty-one senators taking their oaths as judges , and Supreme Court Chief Justice Hilario Davide , Jr .
the trial began on December 7 .
the day-to-day trial was covered on live Philippine television and received the highest viewing rating at the time .
among the highlights of the trial was the testimony of Clarissa Ocampo , senior vice president of Equitable PCI Bank , who testified that she was one foot away from Estrada when he signed the name &quot; Jose Velarde &quot; documents involving a P500 million investment agreement with their bank in February 2000 .
on January 17 , 2001 , the impeachment trial of President Estrada moved to the investigation of an envelope containing crucial evidence that would allegedly prove acts of political corruption by Estrada .
senators allied with Estrada moved to block the evidence .
the conflict between the senator-judges , and the prosecution became deeper , but then Senate Majority Floor Leader Francisco Tatad requested to the Impeachment court to make a vote for opening the second envelope .
the vote resulted in 10 senators in favor of examining the evidence , and 11 senators in favor of suppressing it .
the list of senators who voted for the second envelope are as follows : .
after the vote , Sen.
Aquilino Pimentel , Jr .
resigned as Senate President and walked out of the impeachment proceedings together with the 9 opposition Senators and 11 prosecutors in the Estrada impeachment trial .

at noon , Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo takes her oath of office in the presence of the crowd at EDSA , becoming the 14th president of the Philippines .
at 2 : 00 pm , Estrada releases a letter saying he had &quot; strong and serious doubts about the legality and constitutionality of her proclamation as president &quot; .

they are smiling and waving to reporters and shaking hands with the remaining Cabinet members and palace employees .
he was initially placed under house arrest in San Juan , but was later transferred to his rest home in Sampaloc , a small village in Tanay , Rizal .
world reaction to the administration change was mixed .
though foreign nations , including the United States , immediately expressed recognition of the legitimacy of Arroyo &apos;s presidency , foreign commentators described the revolt as &quot; a defeat for due process of law &quot; , &quot; mob rule &quot; , and a &quot; de facto coup &quot; .

the bottom quark or b quark , also known as the beauty quark , is a third-generation quark with a charge of − 1 / 3 e .
the bottom quark is also notable because it is a product in almost all top quark decays , and is a frequent decay product for the Higgs boson .
the bottom quark was theorized in 1973 by physicists Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa to explain CP violation .
the name &quot; bottom &quot; was introduced in 1975 by Haim Harari .
the bottom quark was discovered in 1977 by the Fermilab E288 experiment team led by Leon M.
Lederman , when collisions produced bottomonium .
Kobayashi and Maskawa won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for their explanation of CP-violation .
on its discovery , there were efforts to name the bottom quark &quot; beauty &quot; , but &quot; bottom &quot; became the predominant usage .
the bottom quark can decay into either an up quark or charm quark via the weak interaction .

optical engineering is the field of study that focuses on applications of optics .
optical engineers design components of optical instruments such as lenses , microscopes , telescopes , and other equipment that utilizes the properties of light .
because optical engineers want to design and build devices that make light do something useful , they must understand and apply the science of optics in substantial detail , in order to know what is physically possible to achieve ( physics and chemistry ) .
however , they also must know what is practical in terms of available technology , materials , costs , design methods , etc .
as with other fields of engineering , computers are important to many ( perhaps most ) optical engineers .
they are used with instruments , for simulation , in design , and for many other applications .

26 sq mi ) walled city was originally located along the shores of the Manila Bay , south of the entrance to Pasig River .
guarding the old city is Fort Santiago , its citadel located at the mouth of the river .
land reclamations during the early 20th-century subsequently obscured the walls and fort from the bay .
Intramuros was heavily damaged during the battle to recapture the city from the Japanese Imperial Army during the Second World War .
reconstruction of the walls was started in 1951 when Intramuros was declared a National Historical Monument , which is continued to this day by the Intramuros Administration ( IA ) .
the Global Heritage Fund identified Intramuros as one of the 12 worldwide sites &quot; on the verge &quot; of irreparable loss and destruction on its 2010 report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage , citing its insufficient management and development pressures .
the strategic location of Manila along the bay and at the mouth of Pasig River made it an ideal location for the Tagalog and Kapampangan tribes and kingdoms to trade with merchants from the peoples from what we now know as China , India , Borneo and Indonesia .
before the first arrival of Europeans on Luzon island , the island was part of the Majapahit empire around the 14th century , according to the epic eulogy poem Nagarakretagama which described its conquest by Mahārāja Hayam Wuruk .
the region was invaded around 1485 by Sultan Bolkiah and became a part of the Sultanate of Brunei .
the site of Intramuros then became a part of the Islamic Kingdom of Maynila a Bruneian puppet-state ruled by Rajah Sulayman , a Muslim Rajah who swore fealty to the Sultan of Brunei .
in 1564 , Spanish explorers led by Miguel López de Legazpi sailed from New Spain ( now Mexico ) , and arrived on the island of Cebu on February 13 , 1565 , establishing the first Spanish colony in the Philippines .
having heard of the rich resources in Manila from the natives , Legazpi dispatched two of his lieutenant-commanders , Martín de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo to explore the island of Luzon .
the Spaniards arrived on the island of Luzon in 1570 .
after quarrels and misunderstandings between the Islamic natives and the Spaniards , they fought for the control of the land and settlements .
after several months of warfare , the natives were defeated , and the Spaniards made a peace pact with the councils of Rajah Sulaiman III , Lakan Dula , and Rajah Matanda who handed over Manila to the Spaniards .
Legazpi declared the area of Manila as the new capital of the Spanish colony on June 24 , 1571 because of its strategic location and rich resources .
he also proclaimed the sovereignty of the Monarchy of Spain over the all the archipelago .
King Philip II of Spain delighted at the new conquest achieved by Legazpi and his men , awarded the city a coat of arms and declaring it as : Ciudad Insigne y Siempre Leal ( English : &quot; distinguished and Ever Loyal City &quot; ) .
Intramuros was settled and became the political , military and religious center of the Spanish Empire in Asia .
the city was in constant danger of natural and man-made disasters and worse , attacks from foreign invaders .
in 1574 , a fleet of Chinese pirates led by Limahong attacked the city and destroyed it before the Spaniards drove them away .
the colony had to be rebuilt again by the survivors .
these attacks prompted the construction of the wall .
the city of stone began during the rule of Governor-General Santiago de Vera .
the city was planned and executed by Jesuit Priest , Antonio Sedeno and was approved by King Philip II &apos;s Royal Ordinance that was issued in San Lorenzo de El Escorial , Spain .
Leonardo Iturriano , a Spanish military engineer specializing in fortifications , headed the project .
Chinese and Filipino workers built the walls .
Fort Santiago was rebuilt and a circular fort , known as Nuestra Senora de Guia , was erected to defend the land and sea on the southwestern side of the city .
funds came from a monopoly on playing cards and fines imposed on its excessive play .
Chinese goods were taxed for two years .
construction of the walls began on 1590 and continued under many governor-generals until 1872 .
by the middle of 1592 , Dasmarinas wrote the King about the satisfactory development of the new walls and fortification .
since the construction was carried on during different periods and often far apart , the walls were not built according to any uniform plan .
improvements continued during the terms of the succeeding Governor-Generals .
Governor-General Juan de Silva executed certain work on the fortifications in 1609 which was improved by Juan Niño de Tabora in 1626 , and by Diego Fajardo Chacón in 1644 .
the erection of the Baluarte de San Diego was also completed that year .
this bastion , shaped like an &quot; ace of spades &quot; is the southernmost point of the wall and the first of the large bastions added to the encircling walls , then of no great height nor of finished construction .
it was the former site of Nuestra Señora de Guia , the very first stone fort of Manila .
ravelins and reductos were added to strengthen weak areas and serve as outer defenses .
a moat was built around the city with the Pasig River serving as a natural barrier on one side .
by the 18th century , the city was totally enclosed .
the last construction works were completed by the start of the 19th century .
the main square of the city of Manila was Plaza Mayor ( later known as Plaza McKinley then Plaza de Roma ) in front of the Manila Cathedral .
East of the plaza was the Ayuntamiento ( City Hall ) and facing it was the Palacio del Gobernador , the official residence of the Spanish viceroyalties to the Philippines .
an earthquake on June 3 , 1863 destroyed the three buildings and much of the city .
the residence of the Governor-General was moved to Malacañang Palace located about 3 km ( 1 .
9 mi ) up on the Pasig River .
the two previous buildings were later rebuilt but not the Governor &apos;s Palace .
inside the walls were other Roman Catholic churches , the oldest being San Agustin Church ( Augustinians ) built in 1607 .
Intramuros was the center of large educational institutions in the country .
convents and church-run schools were established by the different religious orders .
the Dominicans established the Universidad de Santo Tomás in 1611 and the Colegio de San Juan de Letrán in 1620 .
the Jesuits established the Universidad de San Ignacio in 1590 , the first university in the country , but closed in 1768 following the expulsion of the Jesuits in the country .
after the Jesuits were allowed to return to the Philippines , they established the Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1859 .
the seven bastions ( clockwise , from Fort Santiago ) are the Bastions of Tenerias , Aduana , San Gabriel , San Lorenzo , San Andres , San Diego , and Plano .
as mentioned above , the oldest bastion is the San Diego Bastion .
in Fort Santiago , there are bastions on each corner of the triangular fort .
the Santa Barbara Bastion ( Baluarte de Santa Bárbara ) faces the bay and Pasig River ; Baluarte de San Miguel , faces the bay ; Medio Baluarte de San Francisco , Pasig River .
Lucia , and Puerta del Postigo .
formerly , drawbridges were raised and the city was closed and under sentinels from 11 : 00 pm till 4 : 00 am .
it continued so until 1852 , when , in consequence of the earthquake of that year , it was decreed that the gates should thenceforth remain open night and day .
after the end of the Spanish – American War , Spain surrendered the Philippines and several other territories to the United States as part of the terms of the Treaty of Paris for $ 20 million .
the American flag was raised at Fort Santiago on August 13 , 1898 indicating the start of American rule over the city .
the Ayuntamiento became the seat of the Philippine Commission of the United States in 1901 while Fort Santiago became the headquarters of the Philippine Division of the United States Army .
the Americans made drastic changes to the city , such as in 1903 , when the walls from the Santo Domingo Gate up to the Almacenes Gate were removed as the wharf on the southern bank of the Pasig River was improved .

) ; the eastern end of Calle Anda ; the northeastern end of Calle Victoria ( previously known as Calle de la Escuela ) ; and the southeastern end of Calle Palacio ( now General Luna Street ) .
the double moats that surrounded Intramuros were deemed unsanitary and were filled in with mud dredged from Manila Bay where the present Port of Manila is now located .
the moats were transformed into a municipal golf course by the city .
reclamations for the construction of the Port of Manila , the Manila Hotel , and Rizal Park obscured the old walls and skyline of the city from the Manila Bay .
the Americans also founded the first school under the new government , the Manila High School , on June 11 , 1906 along Victoria Street .
in December 1941 , the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the Philippines .
the whole city of Manila was declared by General Douglas MacArthur as an &quot; Open City &quot; as Manila was indefensible .
at the end of World War II , virtually all of the structures in Intramuros were destroyed , with only the damaged Church of San Agustin still standing .
in 1951 , Intramuros was declared a historical monument and Fort Santiago , a national shrine with Republic Act 597 , with the policy of restoring , reconstructing , and urban planning of Intramuros .
several laws and decrees also followed but results were deemed unsatisfactory due to limited funds .
in 1979 , the Intramuros Administration was created by virtue of Presidential Decree № 1616 , signed by President Ferdinand Marcos on April 10 of that year .
since then , the Intramuros Administration ( IA ) has been slowly restoring the walls , the sub-features of the fortification , and the city within .
the remaining five original gates have been restored or rebuilt : Isabel II Gate , Parian Gate , Real Gate , Santa Lucía Gate and the Postigo Gate .
the entrances made by the Americans by breaching the walls at four locations are now spanned by walkways thereby creating a connection , seamless in design and character to the original walls .
Intramuros is the only district of Manila where old Spanish-era influences are still plentiful .
adjacent to Fort Santiago is the reconstructed Maestranza Wall , which was removed by the Americans in 1903 to widen the wharves thus opening the city to Pasig River .
one of the future plans of the Intramuros Administration is to complete the perimeter walls that surround the city making it completely circumnavigable from the walkway on top of the walls .
there has been minimal commercialization occurring within the district , despite restoration efforts .
a few fast food establishments set up shop at the turn of the 21st century , catering mostly to the student population within Intramuros .
Intramuros is still home to one of the oldest educational institutions in the Philippines , the Colegio de San Juan de Letran founded in ( 1620 ) , rebuilding its campus in the same location after its destruction during the war .

Johann Wilhelm Hittorf ( 27 March 1824 – 28 November 1914 ) was a German physicist who was born in Bonn and died in Münster , Germany .
Aavik studied history at the University of Tartu and the University of Nezin in 1905 .
he was a member of the Young Estonia movement and obtained a Doctorate in Romance languages at the University of Helsinki in 1910 .
Aavik taught Estonian and French at Tartu University between 1926 and 1933 .
in 1934 he was appointed by the Estonian Ministry of Education as Chief Inspector of Secondary Schools , a position he held until 1940 .
he fled Soviet occupation in 1944 and lived in Stockholm for the remainder of his life .
Johannes Aavik found that Estonian , which had for centuries been the language of peasants , needed innovation , as its sphere of usage widened rapidly with the emergence of a modern nation .
there was a need for standardization of grammar and orthography as well as new technical terminology .
Aavik added that the language also needed to be versatile and euphonic .
in 1912 he started writing articles to literary journals , making propositions how to develop Estonian language .
he suggested intensive borrowing from Finnish ; many of his suggestions were quickly widely accepted and have become part of standard Estonian vocabulary .
from 1914 he started to artificially create well sounding new word stems to replace awkward compound words .
thus , he proposed relv ( ’ weapon ’ ) instead of sõjariist ( literally ’ war tool ’ ) , roim ( ’ crime ’ ) instead of kuritöö ( ’ evil deed ’ ) and veenma ( ’ convince ’ ) instead of uskuma panema ( ’ make believe ’ ) .
he generally tried to avoid the sounds t and s and preferred shorter words to longer ones .
he also favoured o in successive syllables to u , as is common in the South Estonian dialects .
Aavik tried to modernize even the grammar .
he advocated the usage of i-plural instead of t ( d ) -plural ( keelis pro keeltes ) and the i-superlative instead of the ordinary superlative ( suurim pro kõige suurem ) , as well as – nd instead of – nud in active past participle .
he proposed inflexional affixes to the ma-infinitive , but only some of them entered into popular usage .
he also tried to introduce a future form of verbs and a female personal pronoun , but these got little positive response .
Aavik published numerous essays and translations to propagate his ideas ; he had vocal supporters as well as opponents .
in 1919 , he published a dictionary of 2000 novelty words .
his principles ( utility , aesthetics and native quality ) were summarized in &quot; Keeleuuenduse äärmised võimalused &quot; ( Extreme Perspectives of Language Innovation ; Tartu , 1924 ) .
language innovation slowly died away after the 1927 act that made it compulsory for schools to teach standard Estonian as put down in Estonian Orthographic Dictionary ( 1925 , chief editor J.
Veski ) and Estonian Grammar ( by Elmar Muuk , 1927 ) .
however , some words proposed by Aavik and fallen into oblivion have been picked up and re-introduced by more recent literati .
an essay on linguistic innovation in Estonian by Paul Saagpakk can be found in his Estonian-English Dictionary .
Johannes ( Janne ) Robert Rydberg ( 8 November 1854 – 28 December 1919 ) was a Swedish physicist mainly known for devising the Rydberg formula , in 1888 , which is used to predict the wavelengths of photons ( of light and other electromagnetic radiation ) emitted by changes in the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom .
the physical constant known as the Rydberg constant is named after him , as is the Rydberg unit .
excited atoms with very high values of the principal quantum number , represented by n in the Rydberg formula , are called Rydberg atoms .
Rydberg &apos;s anticipation that spectral studies could assist in a theoretical understanding of the atom and its chemical properties was justified in 1913 by the work of Niels Bohr ( see hydrogen spectrum ) .
an important spectroscopic constant based on a hypothetical atom of infinite mass is called the Rydberg ( R ) in his honour .
he was active at Lund University , Sweden , for all of his working life .
the crater Rydberg on the Moon and asteroid 10506 Rydberg are named in his honour .
there is a pub night held in Rydberg &apos;s honour every Wednesday at the Department of Physics at Lund University .

the role of women in the Philippines is explained based on the context of Filipino culture , standards , and mindsets .
the Philippines is described to be a nation of strong women , who directly and indirectly run the family unit , businesses , government agencies and haciendas .
although they generally define themselves in the milieu of a male-dominated post-colonial society , Filipino women live in a culture that is focused on the community , with the family as the main unit of society , but not always as this is a stereotype .
it is in this framework of Philippine hierarchical structure , class differences , religious justifications , and living in a globally developing nation wherein Filipino women are respected well by men .
when Spain lost the Spanish – American War in 1898 , the Philippines was ceded to the United States of America .
in rural areas , the Filipino woman belongs in the home .
the children approach her for money and help .
she is the family &apos;s treasurer .
for non-family members who require support , the wife is the person to be approached .
however , the wife is neither the person who makes the final decision or the person who hands out the money .
Juan Flavier , a physician , an authority on community development , and a former Philippine senator , described in his book , Doctor to the Barrios , that &quot; whether some ( Filipino ) men are willing to admit it or not &quot; .
&quot; rural women in the Philippines wield considerable authority , &quot; the housewife in particular .
this is especially if the housewife , who is often referred to as the Ilaw ng Tahanan ( Light of the Home ) , is convinced of the benefits that will be gained from a certain practice such as the concept of family planning in the barrios .
children , regardless of gender , and properties were equally divided in a divorce .
in the Philippines , society valued offspring regardless of gender .
the scope of their functions include cooking , cleaning , teaching the children , washing clothes , repairs , budgeting , and helping in the farm .
in general , Filipino women find pride in their work .
they do not find themselves alienated from their chores because they work with , around , and for their families .
the eyes should be exceptionally lively , not the dreamy , sleepy type that characterizes the Mongolian .
the nose should be of the blunt form but firm and strongly marked .
so the ideal Filipino beauty should not necessarily be white complexioned , nor of the dark brown color of the typical Malayan , but of the clear skin or fresh colored type which we often witness when we met a blushing girl .

gross value added = gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption .
value of output = value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventories .
industries ) are classified into various sectors .
after classifying economic activities , the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods : .
GDI should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later .
( by definition , GDI = GDP .
the US &quot; National Income and Expenditure Accounts &quot; divide incomes into five categories : .
two adjustments must be made to get GDP : .
a common one is : .
it measures the value of GDP at factor ( basic ) prices .
the difference between basic prices and final prices ( those used in the expenditure calculation ) is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production .
so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts GDP at factor cost to GDP ( I ) .
total factor income is also sometimes expressed as : .
this is known as the expenditure method of calculating GDP .
, for the effects of inflation or deflation .
to make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons , it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the GDP was measured and the value of money in a base year .
the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used .
GDP per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards .
all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare .
even GDP per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high .
for example , South Africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of GDP per capita , but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the country .

GDP does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work .
some , including Martha Nussbaum , argue that this value should be included in measuring GDP , as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value .
these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve .
in 2009 for instance , the United States estimated its GDP at $ 14 .

at first , only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David , but soon after the tribe of Benjamin joined Judah .
Israel and Judah were in a state of war throughout Rehoboam &apos;s seventeen-year reign .
Rehoboam built elaborate defenses and strongholds , along with fortified cities .
in the fifth year of Rehoboam &apos;s reign , Shishak , pharaoh of Egypt , brought a huge army and took many cities .
Rehoboam &apos;s son and successor , Abijah of Judah continued his father &apos;s efforts to bring Israel under his control .
he fought the Battle of Mount Zemaraim against Jeroboam of Israel and was victorious with a heavy loss of life on the Israel side .
the Bible does not state whether Zerah was a pharaoh or a general of the army .
the Ethiopians were pursued all the way to Gerar , in the coastal plain , where they stopped out of sheer exhaustion .
the resulting peace kept Judah free from Egyptian incursions until the time of Josiah some centuries later .
in his 36th year , Asa was confronted by Baasha of Israel , who built a fortress at Ramah on the border , less than ten miles from Jerusalem .
the result was that the capital was under pressure and the military situation was precarious .
Asa took gold and silver from the Temple and sent them to Ben-Hadad I , king of Aram-Damascus , in exchange for the Damascene king canceling his peace treaty with Baasha .
Ben-Hadad attacked Ijon , Dan , and many important cities of the tribe of Naphtali , and Baasha was forced to withdraw from Ramah .
Asa tore down the unfinished fortress and used its raw materials to fortify Geba and Mizpah in Benjamin on his side of the border .
Asa &apos;s successor , Jehoshaphat , changed the policy towards Israel and instead pursued alliances and co-operation with the northern kingdom .
the alliance with Ahab was based on marriage .
this alliance led to disaster for the kingdom with the battle of Ramoth-Gilead .
he then entered into an alliance with Ahaziah of Israel for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir .
but the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-Geber was immediately wrecked .
a new fleet was fitted out without the cooperation of the king of Israel , and although it was successful , the trade was not prosecuted .
he subsequently joined Jehoram of Israel in a war against the Moabites , who were under tribute to Israel .
this war was successful , with the Moabites being subdued .
however , on seeing Mesha &apos;s act of offering his own son in a human sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth filled Jehoshaphat with horror and he withdrew and returned to his own land .
Jehoshaphat &apos;s successor , Jehoram of Judah formed an alliance with Israel by marrying Athaliah , the daughter of Ahab .
despite this alliance with the stronger northern kingdom , Jehoram &apos;s rule of Judah was shaky .
Edom revolted , and he was forced to acknowledge their independence .
after Hezekiah became sole ruler in c .
715 BCE , he formed alliances with Ashkelon and Egypt , and made a stand against Assyria by refusing to pay tribute .
( Isaiah 30 – 31 ; 36 : 6 – 9 ) In response , Sennacherib of Assyria attacked the fortified cities of Judah .
( 2 Kings 18 : 13 ) Hezekiah paid three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold to Assyria – requiring him to empty the temple and royal treasury of silver and strip the gold from the doorposts of Solomon &apos;s Temple .
( 2 Kings 18 : 14 – 16 ) However , Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 18 : 17 ) in 701 BCE , though the city was never taken .
during the long reign of Manasseh ( c .
687 / 686 – 643 / 642 BCE ) , Judah was a vassal of Assyrian rulers – Sennacherib and his successors , Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal after 669 BCE .
Manasseh is listed as being required to provide materials for Esarhaddon &apos;s building projects , and as one of a number of vassals who assisted Ashurbanipal &apos;s campaign against Egypt .
when Josiah became king of Judah in c .
641 / 640 BCE , the international situation was in flux .
to the east , the Neo-Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate , the Neo-Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it , and Egypt to the west was still recovering from Assyrian rule .
in this power vacuum , Judah was able to govern itself for the time being without foreign intervention .
however , in the spring of 609 BCE , Pharaoh Necho II personally led a sizable army up to the Euphrates to aid the Assyrians .
taking the coast route Via Maris into Syria at the head of a large army , Necho passed the low tracts of Philistia and Sharon .
however , the passage over the ridge of hills which shuts in on the south of the great Jezreel Valley was blocked by the Judean army led by Josiah , who may have considered that the Assyrians and Egyptians were weakened by the death of the pharaoh Psamtik I only a year earlier ( 610 BCE ) .
presumably in an attempt to help the Babylonians , Josiah attempted to block the advance at Megiddo , where a fierce battle was fought and where Josiah was killed .
Necho then joined forces with the Assyrian Ashur-uballit II and together they crossed the Euphrates and lay siege to Harran .
the combined forces failed to capture the city , and Necho retreated back to northern Syria .
the event also marked the disintegration of the Assyrian Empire .
on his return march to Egypt in 608 BCE , Necho found that Jehoahaz had been selected to succeed his father , Josiah .
Necho deposed Jehoahaz , who had been king for only three months , and replaced him with his older brother , Jehoiakim .
Necho imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver ( about 3 3 ⁄ 4 tons or about 3 .
4 metric tons ) and a talent of gold ( about 34 kilograms ( 75 lb ) ) .
Necho then took Jehoahaz back to Egypt as his prisoner , never to return .
Jehoiakim ruled originally as a vassal of the Egyptians , paying a heavy tribute .
however , when the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at Carchemish in 605 BCE , Jehoiakim changed allegiances , paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon .
in 601 BCE , in the fourth year of his reign , Nebuchadnezzar unsuccessfully attempted to invade Egypt and was repulsed with heavy losses .
this failure led to numerous rebellions among the states of the Levant which owed allegiance to Babylon .
Jehoiakim also stopped paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar and took a pro-Egyptian position .
Nebuchadnezzar soon dealt with these rebellions .
the city fell about three months later , on 2 Adar ( March 16 ) 597 BCE .
Nebuchadnezzar pillaged both Jerusalem and the Temple , carting all his spoils to Babylon .
Jeconiah and his court and other prominent citizens and craftsmen , along with a sizable portion of the Jewish population of Judah , numbering about 10,000 were deported from the land and dispersed throughout the Babylonian Empire .
( 2 Kings 24 : 14 ) Among them was Ezekiel .
Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah , Jehoiakim &apos;s brother , king of the reduced kingdom , who was made a tributary of Babylon .
despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others , Zedekiah revolted against Nebuchadnezzar , ceasing to pay tribute to him and entered into an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra .
in 589 BCE , Nebuchadnezzar II returned to Judah and again besieged Jerusalem .
during this period , many Jews fled to surrounding Moab , Ammon , Edom and other countries to seek refuge .
by 586 BCE much of Judah was devastated , and the former kingdom suffered a steep decline of both economy and population .
Jerusalem apparently remained uninhabited for much of the 6th century , and the centre of gravity shifted to Benjamin , the relatively unscathed northern section of the kingdom , where the town of Mizpah became the capital of the new Babylonian province of Yehud for the remnant of the Jewish population in a part of the former kingdom .
this was standard Babylonian practice : when the Philistine city of Ashkelon was conquered in 604 BCE , the political , religious and economic elite ( but not the bulk of the population ) was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location .
Gedaliah was appointed governor of the Yehud Medinata , supported by a Babylonian guard .
the administrative centre of the province was Mizpah in Benjamin , not Jerusalem .
( 2 Kings 25 : 26 , Jeremiah 43 : 5 – 7 ) In Egypt , the refugees settled in Migdol , Tahpanhes , Noph , and Pathros , ( Jeremiah 44 : 1 ) and Jeremiah went with them as a moral guardian .
in 539 BCE the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylonia and allowed the exiles to return to Yehud Medinata and rebuild the Temple , which was completed in the sixth year of Darius ( 515 BCE ) ( Ezra 6 : 15 ) under Zerubbabel , the grandson of the second to last king of Judah , Jeconiah .
at the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Flaccus and Cato ( or , less frequently , year 559 Ab urbe condita ) .
it is sometimes considered synonymous with adulthood .
also , certain cues may cause the organism to become sexually mature .
they may be external , such as drought , or internal , such as percentage of body fat ( such internal cues are not to be confused with hormones which directly produce sexual maturity ) .
sexual maturity is brought about by a maturing of the reproductive organs and the production of gametes .
it may also be accompanied by a growth spurt or other physical changes which distinguish the immature organism from its adult form .
these are termed secondary sex characteristics , and often represent an increase in sexual dimorphism .
year 195 ( CXCV ) was a common year starting on Wednesday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar .

the denomination 195 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .

the strange quark or s quark ( from its symbol , s ) is the third-lightest of all quarks , a type of elementary particle .
Strange quarks are found in subatomic particles called hadrons .
example of hadrons containing strange quarks include kaons ( K ) , strange D mesons ( D s ) , Sigma baryons ( Σ ) , and other strange particles .
the antiparticle of the strange quark is the strange antiquark ( sometimes called antistrange quark or simply antistrange ) , which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign .
the first evidence for the existence of quarks came in 1968 , in deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center .

the Cavite Line was built in 1908 and train services ceased in 1936 .
subsequent development of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport has led to the closure of a big segment of the old line in Pasay and Parañaque .
the line resumes in La Huerta where it is still also called Tramo Road running for 4 .
6 kilometers all the way to Zapote in Las Piñas en route to the line &apos;s terminus in Cavite .

despite the long recognition of its distinction from younger Ordovician Period rocks and older Supereon Precambrian rocks , it was not until 1994 that this time period was internationally ratified .
the base of the Cambrian lies atop a complex assemblage of trace fossils known as the Treptichnus pedum assemblage .
the use of Treptichnus pedum , a reference ichnofossil to mark the lower boundary of the Cambrian , is difficult as the occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the Treptichnids group are found well below the T.
pedum in Namibia , Spain and Newfoundland , and possibly , in the western USA .
the stratigraphic range of T.
pedum overlaps the range of the Ediacaran fossils in Namibia , and probably in Spain .
the Cambrian Period followed the Ediacaran Period and was followed by the Ordovician Period .
the Cambrian is divided into four epochs ( series ) and ten ages ( stages ) .
currently only two series and five stages are named and have a GSSP .
because the international stratigraphic subdivision is not yet complete , many local subdivisions are still widely used .

plate reconstructions suggest a global supercontinent , Pannotia , was in the process of breaking up early in the period , with Laurentia ( North America ) , Baltica , and Siberia having separated from the main supercontinent of Gondwana to form isolated land masses .
most continental land was clustered in the Southern Hemisphere at this time , but was drifting north .
large , high-velocity rotational movement of Gondwana appears to have occurred in the Early Cambrian .
there were likely polar ice caps and a series of glaciations , as the planet was still recovering from an earlier Snowball Earth .
this trend would continue into the Ordovician period .
however , biofilms and microbial mats were well developed on Cambrian tidal flats and beaches 500 mya .

Kan-Laon is the name of an ancient Visayan deity .
during pre-Hispanic times , the deity was worshiped by the natives as their Supreme Ruler .
in the Visayan language , Kan-Laon means &quot; One Who Is the Ruler Of Time .
Canlaon , situated on the island of Negros , is the largest active volcano in the Philippines and highest mountain in the Visayas region .
the mountain is said to be where Laon made his presence felt to the people .
in ancient times , native priests ( babaylan ) would climb up the mountain and do rituals every good harvest season or when there was a special ceremony .
they would also offer gifts as a sign of respect .
Kan-Laon has many counterparts all over the Philippine archipelago .
some of the more popular are Bathala of the Tagalogs , Gugurang of the Bicolanos , and Kabunian of the Ilokanos and Ifugaos .

syllables beginning with &#91; p &#93; are spelled with kana from the h column and the half-voicing mark , handakuten .
syllables beginning with palatalized consonants are spelled with one of the seven consonantal kana from the i row followed by small ya , yu or yo .
these digraphs are called yōon .
the difference in usage between hiragana and katakana is stylistic .
usually , hiragana is the default syllabary , and katakana is used in certain special cases .
hiragana is used to write native Japanese words with no kanji representation ( or whose kanji is thought obscure or difficult ) , as well as grammatical elements such as particles and inflections ( okurigana ) .
today katakana is most commonly used to write words of foreign origin that do not have kanji representations , as well as foreign personal and place names .
katakana is also used to represent onomatopoeia and interjections , emphasis , technical and scientific terms , transcriptions of the Sino-Japanese readings of kanji , and some corporate branding .
kana are the basis for collation in Japanese .

the Second Philippine Republic was only recognized by the Axis powers .
prior to 1935 , the Philippine Islands , an insular area of the United States had the bicameral Philippine Legislature as its legislative body .
the Philippine Legislature was established in 1907 and reorganized in 1916 , pursuant to a U.
the Jones Law provided for a Senate and a House of Representatives , whose membership were elected except for a few , which were appointed by the U.
the Governor-General being the chief executive of the territory also exercised the power to veto any of the Philippine Legislature &apos;s legislations .
it was crafted to prepare the Philippines for its eventual independence after a ten-year period .
the Tydings – McDuffie Act also enabled them to draft and adopt a constitution , subject to the concurrence of the U.
in the constitutional convention that followed , a unicameral National Assembly was adopted .
this came after the failure of the constitutional convention delegates to agree on the setup of the bicameral system that was favored by the majority .
it also set the ceiling on its membership to a maximum of 120 , that were to be elected every three years ; similar to what the Jones Law had provided .
it entitled every province , regardless of its population to have at least one representative .
the convention likewise provided for the direct election of representatives from the non-predominantly Christian areas previously appointed by the U.
after the 1935 Constitution was ratified , elections were held on September 17 , 1935 for the 98 members of the National Assembly ; simultaneous with the elections for the Commonwealth President and Vice President .
the Philippine Commonwealth was inaugurated on November 15 , 1935 and thus the term of the elected officials began .
certain laws dealing with foreign relations and finance however , still required the approval of the U.
Commonwealth President Manuel L.
Quezon , who had practical control of the National Assembly , addressed the body on its inaugural session and laid-out his administration &apos;s priorities and legislative agenda .
among the first of such measures were the National Defense Act of 1935 , which created the Philippine Army ; the creation of the National Economic Council , to serve as an advisory body on economic matters ; and the creation of the Court of Appeals .
several economic measures were also tackled , including the impending difficulties on the phase out of free trade between the Philippines and the United States after independence , setting a minimum wage , and the imposition of new taxes among others .
most of the bills enacted were drafted by the executive branch and the few that originated from the members themselves were often vetoed by Quezon .
in the sessions of the First National Assembly in 1936 , 236 bills were passed , of which 25 bills were vetoed ; while on its 1938 session , 44 out of 105 bills were vetoed due to practical defects , including one which proposed to make religious instruction compulsory in schools – clearly violating the constitutional provision on the separation of Church and State .
the sporadic vetoing of its legislation prompted the &quot; rubber stamp &quot; legislature to criticize Quezon &apos;s policies .
it then began to assert its independence from the executive .
in line with this , the National Assembly went on to reinstate the inherent powers of the Speaker .
the second elections for the National Assembly were held on November 8 , 1938 , under a new law that allowed block voting , which favored the governing Nacionalista Party .
as expected all the 98 seats of the National Assembly went to the Nacionalistas .
José Yulo who was Quezon &apos;s Secretary of Justice from 1934 to 1938 , was elected Speaker .
the Second National Assembly passed legislation to strengthen the economy , unfortunately war loomed .
certain laws passed by the First National Assembly were modified or repealed to meet existing realities .
a controversial immigration law that set an annual limit of 50 immigrants per country , which affected mostly Chinese and Japanese nationals escaping the Sino-Japanese War was passed in 1940 .
when the result of the 1939 census was published , the National Assembly updated the apportionment of legislative districts , which became the basis for the 1941 elections .
Quezon was barred by the 1935 Constitution to serve as president beyond 1941 .
he orchestrated a set of amendments to the constitution that included restoring the bicameral legislature .
it provided for the replacement of the National Assembly by the Congress of the Philippines , composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives .
unlike the Jones Law Senate ( 1916 to 1935 ) , whereby two senators were elected from each of the twelve senatorial districts the Philippines was divided into , the 1940 Amendments prescribed that all the 24 senators were to be elected at-large .
they were to serve for a staggered 6-year term , so that one-third of the Senate membership is replaced every two years .
similar to the National Assembly , the House of Representatives had a cap of 120 members .
the amendments which were contained under Resolution No .
38 were adopted by the National Assembly on September 15 , 1939 , and were ratified in a plebiscite on June 18 , 1940 .
President Franklin D.
Roosevelt approved it on December 2 , 1940 , effectively paving the way for the abolition of the National Assembly after the incumbency of those elected in 1938 on December 30 , 1941 .
the Commonwealth government was exiled in Washington , D.
upon the invitation of Pres .
the Japanese took over Manila on January 2 , 1942 and soon established the Japanese Military Administration to replace the exiled Commonwealth government .
it utilized the existing administrative structure already in place and coerced high-ranking Commonwealth officials left behind to form a government .
in order to win greater support for Japan and its war effort , no less than Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō promised the Filipinos independence earlier than the Tydings – McDuffie Act had scheduled .
but before it could be realized a constitution would have to be adopted .
the Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence drafted what came to be known as the 1943 Constitution .
it provided for a unicameral National Assembly that was to be composed of provincial governors and city mayors as ex-officio members and an elected representative from each province and city who were to serve for a term of three years .
though created subordinate to the executive , the National Assembly had the power to elect the President , who in turn appoints the provincial governors and city mayors , ensuring him control of the legislature .
Jorge B.
Vargas , chairman of the Philippine Executive Commission addressed the National Assembly at its pre-independence session on September 25 , 1943 where KALIBAPI Director-General Benigno Aquino , Sr.
of Tarlac , who served as Agriculture Secretary in the Commonwealth government was elected Speaker of the National Assembly .
on the other hand , former Commonwealth Justice Secretary and Acting Supreme Court Chief Justice José P.
Laurel was elected President of the soon-to-be-independent Republic of the Philippines .
the National Assembly also went to organize itself into 66 committees .
Philippine independence was eventually proclaimed on October 14 , 1943 .
Laurel called the National Assembly into a special session from October 17 to 23 , when it passed resolutions expressing gratitude to the Japanese for its grant of independence .
the National Assembly met for its first regular session from November 25 , 1943 to February 2 , 1944 .
it passed a total of 66 bills and 23 resolutions , ranging from the creation of new government agencies to address the existing problems and conditions during the war and other problems which had not been addressed during the Commonwealth period .
since the Philippines now acted as an independent state , the National Assembly created the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a Central Bank .
it also extended additional powers to the President , similar to those granted to Quezon by the Commonwealth National Assembly .
when it ended its session on February 2 , 1944 , the National Assembly was never to meet again .
it was scheduled to meet for its second regular session on October 20 , 1944 , but American forces had already begun their campaign to liberate the Philippines from Japan with its first attack on Manila on September 21 , 1944 .
this prompted the Japanese to demand the Philippines &apos; declaration of war against the United States .
it was only heeded after a compromise was made that no Filipino would be conscripted into the Japanese military .
two days after the surrender of Japan to the Allied Forces on August 15 , 1945 , and with the Commonwealth government already restored in Manila , Laurel who was by then in prison in Japan dissolved the Second Philippine Republic .
meanwhile , all the laws passed by the Second Republic &apos;s National Assembly were invalidated by a proclamation of Gen.
Douglas MacArthur on October 23 , 1944 just right after reestablishing the Commonwealth government in Tacloban .
the original movie was released back in 1991 .

terrestrial life was well established by the Carboniferous period .
amphibians were the dominant land vertebrates , of which one branch would eventually evolve into amniotes , the first solely terrestrial vertebrates .
a major marine and terrestrial extinction event occurred in the middle of the period , caused by climate change .
the later half of the period experienced glaciations , low sea level , and mountain building as the continents collided to form Pangaea .
in the United States the Carboniferous is usually broken into Mississippian ( earlier ) and Pennsylvanian ( later ) subperiods .
late Pennsylvanian : Gzhelian ( most recent ) .
late Pennsylvanian : Kasimovian .
Middle Pennsylvanian : Moscovian .
early Pennsylvanian : Bashkirian / Morrowan .
late Mississippian : Serpukhovian .
Middle Mississippian : Visean .
early Mississippian : Tournaisian ( oldest ) .
this sea level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian subperiod from the Pennsylvanian subperiod .
this happened about 323 million years ago , at the onset of the Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation .
the Carboniferous was a time of active mountain-building , as the supercontinent Pangaea came together .
the southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana , which collided with North America – Europe ( Laurussia ) along the present line of eastern North America .
most of the Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled , although North China ( which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous ) , and South China continents were still separated from Laurasia .
the Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an &quot; O.
there were two major oceans in the Carboniferous — Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys , which was inside the &quot; O &quot; in the Carboniferous Pangaea .
glaciations in Gondwana , triggered by Gondwana &apos;s southward movement , continued into the Permian and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks , the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as Permo-Carboniferous in age .
the cooling and drying of the climate led to the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse ( CRC ) during the late Carboniferous .
tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change .
the second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding Devonian period .
this promoted the development of extensive lowland swamps and forests in North America and Europe .
the Carboniferous trees made extensive use of lignin .
they had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1 , and even as high as 20 to 1 .
this compares to modern values less than 1 to 4 .
this bark , which must have been used as support as well as protection , probably had 38 % to 58 % lignin .
lignin is insoluble , too large to pass through cell walls , too heterogeneous for specific enzymes , and toxic , so that few organisms other than Basidiomycetes fungi can degrade it .
to oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5 % oxygen , or compounds such as peroxides .
it can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances .
in eastern North America , marine beds are more common in the older part of the period than the later part and are almost entirely absent by the late Carboniferous .
more diverse geology existed elsewhere , of course .
marine life is especially rich in crinoids and other echinoderms .
brachiopods were abundant .
trilobites became quite uncommon .
on land , large and diverse plant populations existed .
land vertebrates included large amphibians .
early Carboniferous land plants , some of which were preserved in coal balls , were very similar to those of the preceding Late Devonian , but new groups also appeared at this time .
the main Early Carboniferous plants were the Equisetales ( horse-tails ) , Sphenophyllales ( scrambling plants ) , Lycopodiales ( club mosses ) , Lepidodendrales ( scale trees ) , Filicales ( ferns ) , Medullosales ( informally included in the &quot; seed ferns &quot; , an artificial assemblage of a number of early gymnosperm groups ) and the Cordaitales .
these continued to dominate throughout the period , but during late Carboniferous , several other groups , Cycadophyta ( cycads ) , the Callistophytales ( another group of &quot; seed ferns &quot; ) , and the Voltziales ( related to and sometimes included under the conifers ) , appeared .
the Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales , which are cousins ( but not ancestors ) of the tiny club-moss of today , were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1 .
5 meters in diameter .
these included Lepidodendron ( with its cone called Lepidostrobus ) , Anabathra , Lepidophloios and Sigillaria .
the roots of several of these forms are known as Stigmaria .
the Cladoxylopsids were large trees , that were ancestors of ferns , first arising in the Carboniferous .
the fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species .
probably many species were epiphytic .
fossil ferns and &quot; seed ferns &quot; include Pecopteris , Cyclopteris , Neuropteris , Alethopteris , and Sphenopteris ; Megaphyton and Caulopteris were tree ferns .
the Equisetales included the common giant form Calamites , with a trunk diameter of 30 to 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a height of up to 20 m ( 66 ft ) .
Sphenophyllum was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves , which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods .
these plants were thought to live in swamps and mangroves .
true coniferous trees ( Walchia , of the order Voltziales ) appear later in the Carboniferous , and preferred higher drier ground .
in the oceans the most important marine invertebrate groups are the Foraminifera , corals , Bryozoa , Ostracoda , brachiopods , ammonoids , hederelloids , microconchids and echinoderms ( especially crinoids ) .
for the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas .
some Carboniferous genera are still extant .
the microscopic shells of radiolarians are found in cherts of this age in the Culm of Devon and Cornwall , and in Russia , Germany and elsewhere .
sponges are known from spicules and anchor ropes , and include various forms such as the Calcispongea Cotyliscus and Girtycoelia , the demosponge Chaetetes , and the genus of unusual colonial glass sponges Titusvillia .
Athyridids , spiriferids , rhynchonellids , and terebratulids are also very common .
inarticulate forms include Discina and Crania .
some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations .
annelids such as Serpulites are common fossils in some horizons .
among the mollusca , the bivalves continue to increase in numbers and importance .
typical genera include Aviculopecten , Posidonomya , Nucula , Carbonicola , Edmondia , and Modiola Gastropods are also numerous , including the genera Murchisonia , Euomphalus , Naticopsis .
nautiloid cephalopods are represented by tightly coiled nautilids , with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare .
Goniatite ammonoids are common .
trilobites are rarer than in previous periods , on a steady trend towards extinction , represented only by the proetid group .
amongst the echinoderms , the crinoids were the most numerous .
dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas , and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock .
prominent genera include Cyathocrinus , Woodocrinus , and Actinocrinus .
echinoids such as Archaeocidaris and Palaeechinus were also present .
the blastoids , which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed , attain their maximum development at this time .

tabulate coral ( a syringoporid ) ; Boone Limestone ( Lower Carboniferous ) near Hiwasse , Arkansas .
freshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various bivalve molluscs that lived in brackish or fresh water , such as Anthraconaia , Naiadites , and Carbonicola ; diverse crustaceans such as Candona , Carbonita , Darwinula , Estheria , Acanthocaris , Dithyrocaris , and Anthrapalaemon .
the Eurypterids were also diverse , and are represented by such genera as Anthraconectes , Megarachne ( originally misinterpreted as a giant spider , hence its name ) and the specialised very large Hibbertopterus .
many of these were amphibious .
frequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as Lingula , Orbiculoidea , and Productus being found in the thin beds known as marine bands .
fossil remains of air-breathing insects , myriapods and arachnids are known from the late Carboniferous , but so far not from the early Carboniferous .
their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment ( mostly swampy fern forests ) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth &apos;s atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today .
this required less effort for respiration and allowed arthropods to grow larger with the up to 2 .
6 metres long millipede-like Arthropleura being the largest known land invertebrate of all time .
among the insect groups are the huge predatory Protodonata ( griffinflies ) , among which was Meganeura , a giant dragonfly-like insect and with a wingspan of ca .
75 cm ( 30 in ) — the largest flying insect ever to roam the planet .
further groups are the Syntonopterodea ( relatives of present-day mayflies ) , the abundant and often large sap-sucking Palaeodictyopteroidea , the diverse herbivorous Protorthoptera , and numerous basal Dictyoptera ( ancestors of cockroaches ) .
many insects have been obtained from the coalfields of Saarbrücken and Commentry , and from the hollow trunks of fossil trees in Nova Scotia .
in the Nova Scotian tree trunks land snails ( Archaeozonites , Dendropupa ) have been found .
most of the sharks were marine , but the Xenacanthida invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps .
among the bony fish , the Palaeonisciformes found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers .
most species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth , fin spines and dermal ossicles , with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole .
freshwater fish were abundant , and include the genera Ctenodus , Uronemus , Acanthodes , Cheirodus , and Gyracanthus .
sharks ( especially the Stethacanthids ) underwent a major evolutionary radiation during the Carboniferous .
it is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the placoderms at the end of the Devonian period caused many environmental niches to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches .
the largest were over 2 meters long .
they were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the Lepospondyli , often only about 15 cm ( 6 in ) long .
the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler , drier conditions .
reptiles , however , prospered due to specific key adaptations .
these included the earliest sauropsid reptiles ( Hylonomus ) , and the earliest known synapsid ( Archaeothyris ) .
by the end of the Carboniferous period , amniotes had already diversified into a number of groups , including protorothyridids , captorhinids , araeoscelids , and several families of pelycosaurs .
the amphibian-like Pederpes , the most primitive Mississippian tetrapod .
Hylonomus , the earliest sauropsid reptile , appeared in the Pennsylvanian .
Petrolacosaurus , the first diapsid reptile known , lived during the late Carboniferous .
Archaeothyris was a very early synapsid and the oldest known .
because plants and animals were growing in size and abundance in this time ( for example , Lepidodendron ) , land fungi diversified further .
marine fungi still occupied the oceans .
all modern classes of fungi were present in the Late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian Epoch ) .
the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous had very limited terrestrial fossils .
this gap in the fossil record is called Romer &apos;s gap after the American palaentologist Alfred Romer .
while it has long been debated whether the gap is a result of fossilisation or relates to an actual event , recent work indicates the gap period saw a drop in atmospheric oxygen levels , indicating some sort of ecological collapse .
the gap saw the demise of the Devonian fish-like ichthyostegalian labyrinthodonts , and the rise of the more advanced temnospondyl and reptiliomorphan amphibians that so typify the Carboniferous terrestrial vertebrate fauna .
before the end of the Carboniferous Period , an extinction event occurred .
on land this event is referred to as the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse ( CRC ) .
this was likely caused by intense glaciation and a drop in sea levels .
the new climatic conditions were not favorable to the growth of rainforest and the animals within them .
towering lycopsid forests with a heterogeneous mixture of vegetation were replaced by much less diverse tree-fern dominated flora .

Carl Adolph von Basedow ( 28 March 1799 – 11 April 1854 ) was a German physician most famous for reporting the symptoms of what could later be dubbed Graves-Basedow disease , now technically known as exophthalmic goiter .
Basedow was born in Dessau .
he graduated from Halle University .
he subsequently began general practice in Merseburg in 1822 .
he married early and became the town &apos;s chief medical officer , a position he would hold for the rest of his life .
in 1840 , Basedow reported on the conditions of what is now called Graves-Basedow disease .
he died in Merseburg in 1854 after contracting spotted fever from a corpse he was dissecting .
Basedow has three eponymous medical conditions : Basedow &apos;s coma , a thyreotoxic coma ; Basedow &apos;s ocular syndromes , the unilateral retraction of the upper lid in Basedow ’ s syndrome ; and , Graves-Basedow disease , a disorder characterized by the &quot; Merseburger triad &quot; : tachycardia , goitre , and exophthalmos .
Ulrichs was born in Aurich in Lower Saxony , then part of the Kingdom of Hanover .
Ulrichs recalled that as a young child he wore girls &apos; clothes , preferred playing with girls , and wanted to be a girl .
his first homosexual experience was in 1839 at the age of fourteen , in the course of a brief affair with his riding instructor .
he graduated in law and theology from Göttingen University in 1846 .
from 1846 to 1848 , he studied history at Berlin University , writing a dissertation in Latin on the Peace of Westphalia .
from 1849 to 1857 Ulrichs worked as an official legal adviser for the district court of Hildesheim in the Kingdom of Hanover .
he was dismissed when his homosexuality became open knowledge .
in 1862 , Ulrichs took the momentous step of telling his family and friends that he was , in his own words , an Urning , and began writing under the pseudonym of &quot; Numa Numantius &quot; .
in these essays , Ulrichs coined various terms to describe different sexual orientations , including Urning for a man who desires men ( English &quot; Uranian &quot; ) , and Dioning for one who desires women .
these terms are in reference to a section of Plato &apos;s Symposium in which two kinds of love are discussed , symbolised by an Aphrodite who is born from a male ( Uranos ) , and an Aphrodite who is born from a female ( Dione ) .
Ulrichs also coined words for the female counterparts ( Urningin and Dioningin ) , and for bisexuals and intersexual persons .
he soon began publishing under his real name ( possibly the first public &quot; coming out &quot; in modern society ) and wrote a statement of legal and moral support for a man arrested for homosexual offences .
on August 29 , 1867 , Ulrichs became the first homosexual to speak out publicly in defence of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws .
he was shouted down .
two years later , in 1869 , the Austrian writer Karl-Maria Kertbeny coined the word &quot; homosexual &quot; , and from the 1870s the subject of sexual orientation ( as we would now say ) began to be widely discussed .
in the 1860s , Ulrichs moved around Germany , always writing and publishing , and always in trouble with the law — though always for his words rather than for sexual offences .
in 1864 , his books were confiscated and banned by police in Saxony .
later the same thing happened in Berlin , and his works were banned throughout Prussia .
some of these papers were found in the Prussian state archives and were published in 2004 .
already several of Ulrichs &apos;s more important works are back in print , both in German and in translation .
Ulrichs was a patriotic Hannoverian , and when Prussia annexed Hannover in 1866 he was briefly imprisoned for opposing Prussian rule .
the next year he left Hannover for good and moved to Munich , where he addressed the Association of German Jurists on the need to reform German laws against homosexuality .
later he lived in Würzburg and Stuttgart .
in 1879 , Ulrichs published the twelfth and final book of his Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love .
in poor health , and feeling he had done all he could in Germany , he went into self-imposed exile in Naples .
for several years he travelled around the country before settling in L &apos;Aquila , where his health improved .
he continued to write prolifically and publish his works ( in German and Latin ) at his own expense .
in 1895 , he received an honorary diploma from the University of Naples .
shortly afterwards he died in L &apos;Aquila .
his gravestone is marked ( in Latin ) , &quot; Exile and Pauper .
&quot; &quot; Pauper &quot; may have been a bit of a romantic licence .
Ulrichs lived in L &apos;Aquila as the guest of a local landowner , Marquis Niccolò Persichetti , who gave the eulogy at his funeral .
at the end of his eulogy , he said : .
many have been driven to suicide because all their happiness in life was tainted .
indeed , I am proud that I found the courage to deal the initial blow to the hydra of public contempt .
Magnus Hirschfeld thoroughly referenced Ulrichs in his The Homosexuality of Men and Women ( 1914 ) .
the Urning is also a citizen .
the state is not authorized , as in the past , to treat Urnings as outside the pale of the law .
the prohibition of the expression of the sex drive , i .
, between consenting adults in private , lies outside the legal sphere .
all grounds for legal prosecution are lacking in this case .
legislators are hindered from doing this by human rights and the principle of the constitutional state .
as long as the Urning respects guidelines ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) above , the legislator may not prohibit him from following the rightful law of nature to which he is subject .
the law of liberty in the constitutional state also has to consider its minorities .
and no matter what the legislators have done in the past , the law of liberty knows of no limitation .
legislators should give up hope at the beginning of uprooting the Uranian sexual drive at any time .
even the fiery pyres upon which they burned Urnings in earlier centuries could not accomplish this .
even to gag and tie them up was useless .
the battle against nature is a hopeless one .
even the most powerful government , with all the means of coercion it can bring to bear , is too weak against nature .
on the other hand , the government is capable of controlling the battle .

Kasaoka ( 笠岡市 , Kasaoka-shi ? ) is a city located in Okayama Prefecture , Japan .
during World War II , much of the city was destroyed , but the city was rebuilt in after the war .
the idea that the plant name is actually &quot; nilad &quot; is baseless .
it was also known as Gintu ( &quot; The Land / Island of Gold &quot; ) or Suvarnadvipa by its neighbors .
its rulers were equivalents to kings and not mere chieftains , and they were addressed as panginuan or panginoon ( &quot; lords &quot; ) , anak banwa ( &quot; son of heaven &quot; ) or lakandula ( &quot; lord of the palace &quot; ) .
powerful states like Lubao , Betis and Macabebe became bold enough to challenge the traditional leadership of Tondo and Maynila .
in about the same year , the Spaniards returned , this time led by López de Legazpi himself along with his entire force ( consisting of 280 Spaniards and 600 native allies ) .
the title was certified on June 19 , 1572 .
under Spain , Manila became the colonial entrepot in the Far East .
because of the Spanish presence in the area , the Chinese people , who were living in the area and engaging in free trade relations with the natives , were subjected to commercial restrictions as well as laws requiring them to pay tribute to Spanish authorities .
as a result , the Chinese revolted against the Spaniards in 1574 , when a force of about 3,000 men and 62 Chinese warships under the command of Limahong attacked the city .
the said attempt was fruitless , and the Chinese were defeated .
however , the Muslim , Rajah Sulayman , refused to submit to the Spaniards and gathered together a force composed of Tagalog warriors after failing to get the support of Lakan Dula and that of the leaders of Hagonoy and Macabebe .
on June 3 , 1571 , Sulayman led his troops and attacked the Spaniards in a decisive battle at the town of Bangkusay , but were defeated .
the first missionaries to arrive were the Augustinians , followed by the Franciscans , Jesuits , Dominicans , Augustinians and other religious orders .
in 1595 , Manila was decreed to be the capital of the Philippines , although it had already in fact served that function practically from its founding in 1571 .
at various times in the following century , the Chinese rose in revolt against the Spaniards .
the British accepted the written surrender of the Philippines from Archbishop Rojo and the Real Audiencia on 30 October 1762 .
the terms of surrender dated 29 October 1762 signed by Archbishop Rojo , and sealed with the Spanish Royal Seal , ceding the entire archipelago to Great Britain .
this was rejected by Simón de Anda y Salazar who claimed to have been appointed Governor-General under the Statutes of the Indies .
the Seven Years &apos; War was ended by the Peace of Paris signed on 10 February 1763 .
at the time of signing the treaty , the signatories were not aware that Manila had been taken by the British and was being administered as a British colony .
consequently , no specific provision was made for the Philippines .
the seeds of revolution germinated in 1886 with the publication of José Rizal &apos;s book Noli Me Tangere ( Touch Me Not ) , a novel critical of the way the Spanish friars were governing the Philippines .
the Spanish government condemned the book , and Rizal was exiled to Dapitan .
in 1892 , he returned to Manila to found La Liga Filipina , a nationalistic organization .
troops invaded Manila in 1898 and waged war with the Spaniards and Filipinos in the Spanish – American War and the Philippine – American War .
following the defeat of Spain , U.
forces took control of the city and the islands in one of the most brutal and forgotten chapters of Philippine American history .
the American Navy , under Admiral George Dewey , defeated the Spanish squadron in the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1 , 1898 .
during the Battle of Manila the Americans took control of Manila from the Spanish .
Admiral Dewey testified that after the battle the Spanish Governor wished to surrender to the Americans rather than the Filipinos .
in the Treaty of Paris in 1898 , Spain handed over the Philippines to the United States of America for US $ 20,000,000 and ending 333 years of Spanish rule in the islands .
having just won their independence from Spain , the Filipinos were fiercely opposed to once again being occupied .
Manila continued under an American military government until civil government was established for the city on July 31 , 1901 .
Vargas assumed the chairmanship of the Philippine Executive Commission and appointed to the post of Mayor of Greater Manila in 1942 , Leon G.
Guinto Sr.
on October 20 , 1944 , American and Philippine Commonwealth troops , led by American General Douglas MacArthur , began the reconquest of the Philippines .
on July 4 , 1946 , the Philippine flag was raised for the first time in Rizal Park .
recorded Jewish history in the Philippines started during the Spanish period .
the Spanish Inquisition in the 16th Century forced many Jews in Spain to convert to Christianity or to flee .
two &quot; New Christian &quot; brothers , Jorge and Domingo Rodríguez , arrived in the Spanish Philippines in the 1590s .
such was the precarious status of Jewish settlers in the Philippines .
Jewish presence during the subsequent centuries of Spanish colonization remained small and unorganized .
Spanish Christianized laws would not have permitted the presence of an organized Jewish community .
when the Philippines became an American concern , American Jewish citizens took advantage of this new frontier .
the arrival of American military forces to the Philippines brought Jewish servicemen who decided to remain in the islands after their military discharge and become permanent residents .
Jewish teachers from the United States also arrived with a contingent of &quot; Thomasites , &quot; a delegation of volunteer teachers , who gave public instruction to Filipino children .
in addition to education , new markets for import-export businesses attracted young Jewish businessmen , who set up new shops in the Philippines or extended businesses from the U.
three important names appear in the Jewish community around the start of the 20th century : Emil Bachrach and Morton I.
Emil Bachrach arrived in Manila in 1901 and soon built a sizable commercial empire .
because he is regarded as the first American Jew who permanently settled in the Philippines , the synagogue and cultural hall , which the Bachrach family financed in subsequent decades , bore his name : temple Emil and Bachrach Hall .
Joseph Cysner became the caretaker of the Temple .
Bachrach &apos;s economic successes allowed him to be a generous philanthropist , who supported both Jewish and Christian causes .
economic prosperity , along with a high level of societal interaction , apparently precluded the need for strong Jewish institutions .
theirs was a 19th-century lifestyle of the very rich .
although the Jewish families did go to the Temple for special occasions , and the existence of an adjacent social hall did serve to centralize and focus Jewish cultural life , it was still very low-key .
most prisoners were interned for the full three years until the end of the war in 1945 .
rumors about forcing the German Jews into a ghetto began to circulate .
temple Emil and Bachrach Hall had been totally destroyed .
and Filipino soldiers provided not only food , water , supplies , and medicine for the victims , but also donated $ 15,000 for the rebuilding of the synagogue .

Matsue Castle ( 松江城 , Matsue-jō ? ) is a feudal castle in Matsue in Shimane prefecture , Japan .
nicknamed the &quot; black castle &quot; or &quot; plover castle &quot; , it is one of the few remaining medieval castles in Japan – at least of the few remaining in their original wooden form , and not a modern reconstruction in concrete .
the construction of Matsue Castle began in 1607 and finished in 1611 , under the local lord Horio Yoshiharu .
in 1638 , the fief and castle passed to the Matsudaira clan , a junior branch of the ruling Tokugawa clan .
most Japanese castles have been damaged or destroyed by war , earthquakes , or other causes .
since a large part of their construction was wooden , fire was a major hazard .
Matsue castle was built after the last great war of feudal Japan , so it never saw a battle .
yet only some of the walls and the keep exist today .
of the 12 castles remaining in Japan , this is the only one remaining in the Sanin region .

Katherine or Catherine is a feminine name .
the Katipunan is also known by its acronym , KKK .
in planning the revolution , Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention .
in May 1896 , a delegation was sent to the Emperor Meiji in order to solicit funds and military arms .
this organization was part of the late 19th century Propaganda Movement in the Philippines .
Katipunan founders Andrés Bonifacio , Ladislao Diwa , and Teodoro Plata were all members of La Liga and were influenced by the nationalistic ideals of the Propaganda Movement in Spain .
modern-day historians believe that he had a direct hand in its organization because of his role in the Propaganda Movement and his eminent position in Philippine Masonry ; most of the Katipunan &apos;s founders were freemasons .
it also had a hierarchy of rank that was similar to that of freemasonry .
one group insisted on La Liga &apos;s principle of a peaceful reformation while the other espoused armed revolution .
on the night of July 7 , 1892 , when José Rizal was banished and exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao , Andrés Bonifacio , a member of the La Liga Filipina , founded the Katipunan in a house in San Nicolas , Manila .
Bonifacio did establish the Katipunan when it was becoming apparent to anti-Spanish Filipinos that societies like the La Liga Filipina would be suppressed by colonial authorities .
he was assisted by his two friends , Teodoro Plata ( brother-in-law ) and Ladislao Diwa , plus Valentín Díaz and Deodato Arellano .
the Katipunan was founded along Azcarraga St.
( now Recto Avenue ) near Elcano St.
despite their reservations about the peaceable reformation that Rizal espoused , they named Rizal honorary president without his knowledge .
the Katipunan , established as a secret brotherhood organization , went under the name Kataas-taasang , Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃á Anak ng̃ Bayan ( Supreme and Venerable Society of the Children of the Nation ) .
the Katipunan had four aims , namely : .
the rise of the Katipunan signaled the end of the crusade to secure reforms from Spain by means of a peaceful campaign .
the Propaganda Movement led by Rizal , del Pilar , Jaena and others had failed its mission ; hence , Bonifacio started the militant movement for independence .
the first Supreme Council of the Katipunan was formed around August 1892 , a month after the founding of the society .
the Supreme Council was headed by an elected president ( Pangulo ) , followed by the secretary / secretaries ( Kalihim ) ; the treasurer ( Tagaingat-yaman ) and the fiscal ( Tagausig ) .
at the outbreak of the 1896 revolution , the Council was further reorganized into a &apos; cabinet &apos; which the Katipunan regarded as a genuine revolutionary government , de facto and de jure .
in each province where there were Katipunan members , a provincial council called Sangguniang Bayan was established and in each town was an organized popular council called Sangguniang Balangay .
within the society functioned a secret chamber , called Camara Reina , which was presided over by Bonifacio , Jacinto , and Pío Valenzuela .
every katipunero stood in fearful awe of this chamber .
according to José P.
in 1892 , after the Katipunan was founded , the members of the Supreme Council consisted of Arellano as president , Bonifacio as comptroller , Diwa as fiscal , Plata as secretary and Díaz as treasurer .
in 1893 , the Supreme Council comprised Ramón Basa as president , Bonifacio as fiscal , José Turiano Santiago as secretary , Vicente Molina as treasurer and Restituto Javier , Briccio Pantas , Teodoro Gonzales .
Gonzales , Plata , and Diwa were councilors .
it was during Basa &apos;s term that the society organized a women &apos;s auxiliary section .
two of its initial members were Gregoria de Jesús , whom Bonifacio had just married , and Marina Dizon , daughter of José Dizon .
it was also in 1893 when Basa and Diwa organized the provincial council of Cavite , which would later be the most successful council of the society .
the Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw reports that Basa yielded the presidency to Bonifacio in 1894 because of a dispute over the usefulness of the initiation rites and Bonifacio &apos;s handling of the society &apos;s buts .
Basa contested Bonifacio &apos;s practice of lending their funds to needy members , complete with promissory notes .
moreover , Basa refused to induct his son into the organization .
it was also in 1894 when Emilio Jacinto , a nephew of Dizon who was studying law at the University of Santo Tomas , joined the Katipunan .
he intellectualized the society &apos;s aims and formulated the principles of the society as embodied in its primer , called Kartilla .
it was written in Tagalog and all recruits were required to commit it to heart before they were initiated .
Jacinto would later be called the Brains of the Katipunan .
Kalayaan was published through the printing press of the Spanish newspaper Diario de Manila .
this printing press and its workers would later play an important role in the outbreak of the revolution .
in 1895 , José Turiano Santiago , a close personal friend of Bonifacio , was expelled because a coded message of the Katipunan fell into the hands of a Spanish priest teaching at the University of Santo Tomas .
Jacinto replaced Santiago as secretary .
on December 31 , 1895 , another election named Bonifacio as president , Jacinto as Fiscal , Santiago as secretary , Molina as secretary , Pío Valenzuela and Pantaleon Torres as physicians , and Aguedo del Rosario and Doreteo Trinidad as councilors .
the members of the Supreme Council in 1895 were Bonifacio as president , Valenzuela as fiscal and physician , Jacinto as secretary , and Molina as treasurer .
Enrico Pacheco , Pantaleon Torres , Balbino Florentino , Francisco Carreón and Hermenegildo Reyes were named councilers .
eight months later , in August 1896 , the fifth and last supreme council was elected to renamed offices .
Bonifacio was named Supremo , Jacinto Secretary of State , Plata Secretary of War , Bricco Pantas Secretary of Justice , Aguedo del Rosario Secretary of Interior and Enrice Pacheco Secretary of Finance .
over the next four years , the Katipunan founders would recruit new members .
by the time the society was uncovered , the American writer James Le Roy estimated the strength of the Katipunan at 100,000 to 400,000 members .
historian Teodoro Agoncillo estimated that the membership had increased to around 30,000 by 1896 .
the Ilocano writer Isabelo de los Reyes estimated membership at 15,000 to 50,000 .
aside from Manila , the Katipunan also had sizeable chapters in Batangas , Laguna , Cavite , Rizal , Bulacan , Pampanga , Tarlac and Nueva Ecija .
there were also smaller chapters in Ilocos Sur , Ilocos Norte , Pangasinan and the Bicol region .
the Katipunan founders spent their free time recruiting members .
he initiated members in that province as well as Bulacan , Tarlac , and Nueva Ecija .
he formed his first triangle with his two comrades , Teodoro Plata and Ladislao Diwa .
each of them re-instituted Katipunan thoughts into another two new converts .
in the meeting of the society , Katipon wore a black hood with a triangle of white ribbon having the letters &quot; Z.
&quot; , corresponding to the roman &quot; A.
&quot; at the three angles of the triangle , and also wore a green ribbon with a medal with the letter ( ka ) in Baybayin script above a depiction of a crossed sword and flag .
the password was Gom-Bur-Za , taken from the names of the three martyrs Mariano Gomez , Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora .
Bayani ( Hero ) wore a red mask and a sash with green borders , symbolizing courage and hope .
the front of the mask had white borders that formed a triangle with three Ks arranged as if occupying the angles of a triangle within a triangle , and with the letters &quot; Z.
&quot; below .
another password was Rizal .
countersigns enabled members to recognize one another on the street .
a member meeting another member placed the palm of his right hand on his breast and , as he passed the other member , he closed the hands to bring the right index finger and thumb together .
color designations : .
Katipon could graduate to Kawal class by bringing several new members into the society .
a Kawal could become a Bayani upon being elected an officer of the society .
any person who wished to join the Katipunan was subjected to certain initiation rites , resembling those of Masonic rites , to test his courage , patriotism , and loyalty .
new recruits underwent the initiation rite three at a time so that no member knew more than two other members of the society .
there , they would condemn the abuses of the Spanish government and vow to fight colonial oppression : .
during Bonifacio &apos;s time , all of the Filipino people are referred collectively by the Katipunan as Tagalogs , while Philippines is Katagalugan .
the next step in the initiation ceremony was the lecture given by the master of ceremonies , called Mabalasig / Mabalasik ( terrible brother ) , who informed the neophyte to withdraw if he lacked courage since he would be out of place in the patriotic society .
if the neophyte persisted , he was presented to the assembly of the brethren , who subjected him to various ordeals such as blindfolding him and making him shoot a supposedly a revolver at a person , or forcing him to jump over a supposedly hot flame .
after the ordeals came to final rite – the pacto de sangre or blood compact – in which the neophyte signed the oath with blood taken from his arm .
he was then accepted as a full-pledged member , with a symbolic name by which he was known within Katipunan circles .
Bonifacio &apos;s symbolic name was Maypagasa ; Jacinto was Pingkian and Artemio Ricarte was Vibora .
at first , Katipunan was purely a patriotic society for men .
owing to the growing suspicion of the women regarding nocturnal absences of their husbands , the reduction of their monthly earnings and &quot; long hours of work &quot; , Bonifacio had to bring them into the realms of the KKK .
a section for women was established in the society : to become admitted , one must be a wife , a daughter , or a sister of a male katipunero .
it was estimated that from 20 to 50 women had become members of the society .
initially , there were 29 women were admitted to the Katipunan : Gregoria de Jesús , Maria Dizon , president of the women &apos;s section ; Josefa and Trinidad Rizal , sisters of Dr.
José Rizal ; Angelica Lopez and Delfina Herbosa Natividad , close relatives of Dr.
Rizal ; Carmén de Rodriguez ; Marina Hizon ; Benita Rodriguez ; Semiona de Rémigio ; Gregoria Montoya ; Agueda Kahabagan , Teresa Magbanua , Trinidad Tecson , rendered as &quot; Mother of Biak-na-Bato &quot; ; Nazaria Lagos ; Patronica Gamboa ; Marcela Agoncillo ; Melchora Aquino , the &quot; Grand Old Woman of Balintawak &quot; ; Marta Saldaña and Macaria Pañgilinan .
the women rendered valuable services to the Katipunan .
they guarded the secret papers and documents of the society .
whenever the Katipunan held sessions in a certain house , they usually made merry , singing and dancing with some of the men in the living room so that the civil guard were led that there was nothing but a harmless social party within .
though women are considered to be members of the Katipunan , information regarding the women &apos;s section were scarce and sometimes conflicting .
Teodoro Agoncillo , for example , disregarded Marina Dizon and concluded that Josefa Rizal was the only president of the said section .
Gregorio Zaide , on the other hand , mentioned Dizon &apos;s presidency in his 1939 publication History of the Katipunan but changed his mind when he adopted Dr.
Pío Valenzuela &apos;s notion that women-members did not elect officers , hence there is no room for president .
during Katipunan &apos;s existence , literature flourished through prominent writers of the Katipunan : Andrés Bonifacio , Emilio Jacinto and Dr.
Pío Valenzuela .
each of the three &apos;s works were stirring literature of patriotism and are aimed to spread the revolutionary thoughts and ideals of the society .
it was first published March 1896 ( even though its masthead was dated January 1896 .
) The first Kalayaan issue has never been followed .
in 1895 , the Katipunan bought an old hand-press with the money generously donated by two Visayan co-patriots Francisco del Castillo and Candido Iban – who returned to the country after working as shell and pearl divers in Australia and had some money from a lottery win .
they bought the press and a small quantity of types from Antonio Salazar &apos;s &quot; Bazar del Cisne &quot; on Calle Carriedo , and Del Castillo transported it to the house of Andrés Bonifacio in Santa Cruz , Manila .
on January 1 , 1896 , Valenzuela accepted the position as the Katipunan &quot; fiscal &quot; in exchange of Bonifacio &apos;s consent to send the printing press on his house in Calle de Lavezares , San Nicolas , Manila , &quot; so that he could assist and edit a monthly publication which would be the Katipunan &apos;s main organ &quot; .
even though Valenzuela was chosen to become the editor of the organ , they all decided to use the name of Marcelo H.
del Pilar as its editor .
that very same month , January 1896 , the publication of Kalayaan was started .
Valenzuela expected it to finish at the end of the month , so they dated it as January .
the existence of the press was kept in utmost secrecy .
under the supervision of Valenzuela , two printers , Faustino Duque , a student from Colegio de San Juan de Letran , and Ulpiano Fernández , a part-time printer at El Comercio , printed the revolutionary literature of the society and Kalayaan .
when Valenzuela was appointed the physician-general of the Katipunan , he passed on his editorial duties to Emilio Jacinto .
Jacinto took the job , editing articles after his pre-law classes in University of Santo Tomas .
since the press was in the old orthography and not in the new &quot; Germanized &quot; alphabet , as called by the Spaniards , there are no Tagalog letters such as &quot; k &quot; , &quot; w &quot; , &quot; h &quot; and &quot; y &quot; .
to solve this problem , Jacinto obliged his mother , Josefa Dizon , to buy types that resembles such letters .
the types used in printing were purchased from publisher Isabelo de los Reyes , but many were taken surreptitiously from the press of the Diario de Manila by Filipino employees who were also members of the Katipunan .
according to Valenzuela , the printing process was so laborious that setting just eight pages of typesets required two months to complete .
in March 1896 , the first copies were issued ( dated January 1896 ) , and about 2,000 prints were circulated in secret , according to Valenzuela .
according to Epifanio de los Santos , only 1,000 copies were printed : 700 was distributed by Bonifacio , 300 by Aguinaldo , and some 100 by Valenzuela himself .
copies of which were distributed among the members of the society .
Kartilya was written by Emilio Jacinto , and later revised by Emilio Aguinaldo .
the term kartilya was derived from Spanish cartilla , which was a primer for grade school students before going to school at that time .
according to Filipino writer and historian Hermenegildo Flores , the official language of the Katipunan is Tagalog , and uses an alphabet nearly similar to Spanish alphabet but has different meaning and the way it was read was changed .
what is the language used by the members of the Katipunan ? .
presented below is the Katipunan alphabet , when compared to the Spanish alphabet .
the night when Governor-General Eulogio Despujol y Dusay exiled Dr.
José Rizal to Dapitan , Katipunan was founded .
in a secret meeting of the Katipunan at a little creek called Bitukang Manok near Pasig on May 4 , 1896 , Bonifacio and his councilors decided to consult Rizal regarding a decision to revolt .
: 26 – 27 Bonifacio delegated Dr.
Pío Valenzuela as the Katipunan &apos;s emissary to Dapitan .
: 28 This was done in order to inform Rizal of Katipunan &apos;s plan to launch a revolution and , if possible , a war against Spain .
by the end of May 1896 , Dr.
Valenzuela had visited and interviewed Rizal at Dapitan .
: 29 As cover , Dr.
Valenzuela was accompanied by a blind man named Raymundo Mata , since at the time Rizal was known to have specialized in ophthalmology .
Valenzuela arrived in Dapitan on June 21 , where Rizal welcomed him .
after supper , Valenzuela told him the real reason why he went to Dapitan and the necessity of securing Rizal &apos;s support .
according to Valenzuela , Rizal only answered , &quot; Huwag , huwag ! Iya &apos;y makasasama sa bayang Pilipino ! &quot; ( no , no ! that will harm the Filipino nation ! ) .
Rizal objected to Bonifacio &apos;s audacious project to plunge the country into a bloody revolution .
he believed it was premature for two reasons : .
because of this notion , Valenzuela made another proposal to Rizal : to rescue him .
Rizal disapproved of this plan , because he had given his word of honor to the Spanish authorities , and he did not want to break it .
instead , Rizal advised Valenzuela to persuade wealthy Filipinos , so that they can solicit funds , where he recommended an elite army officer name Antonio Luna to be Katipunan &apos;s war general , should a revolution break out .
according to Valenzuela &apos;s statement to the Spanish authorities , they almost quarreled over the matter and Valenzuela left the following day instead of staying for a month as originally planned .
when Valenzuela returned to Manila and informed the Katipunan of his failure to secure Rizal &apos;s sanction , Bonifacio , furious , warned Valenzuela not to tell anyone of Rizal &apos;s refusal to support the impending uprising .
however , Valenzuela had already spread the word , so that much fund proposals to the society were canceled .
despite Rizal &apos;s rejection , the Katipunan was already trying to address its arms supply problem and had taken steps to smuggle in weapons from abroad .
at his trial , Rizal denied that he knew Valenzuela , saying only that he met him first at Dapitan and that he considered him a good friend because of what Valenzuela showed to him and his appreciation of medical tools Valenzuela gave to him .
he also said that this was the last time they met .
despite Rizal &apos;s rejection of an armed revolution , Bonifacio continued to plan for an armed conflict with Spain .
the Katipunan cast its eyes on Japan , which loomed then as the probable champion of Asian liberties against Western oppression at the time .
in May 1896 , after Valenzuela &apos;s visit to Rizal , a delegation of Katipunan members , headed by Jacinto and Bonifacio , conferred with a visiting Japanese naval officer and captain of a Japanese ship , named Kongo , and the Japanese consul at a Japanese bazaar in Manila .
the interpreter , a friend of Valenzuela , was José Moritaro Tagawa who was married to a Filipino woman of Bocaue , Bulacan .
after the usual exchange of courtesies , Jacinto submitted the Katipunan memorial for the Emperor of Japan in which the Filipinos prayed for Japanese aid in their projected revolution , &quot; so that the light of liberty that illuminates Japan may also shed its rays over the Philippines .
it was with good reason that the Katipunan solicited Japan &apos;s aid and alliance .
Japan had been friendly to the Filipinos since the Spanish colonial era .
many Filipinos who had fled from Spanish persecution had been welcomed there and given full protection of Japanese laws .
three months later , however , the Katipunan was uncovered and Dizon was among the hundreds who were arrested for rebellion .
as the Katipunan was busy preparing for the revolution , various denunciations regarding its existence reached the Spanish authorities .
on July 5 , 1896 , Manuél Sityar , a Spanish lieutenant of the guardia civíl stationed at Pasig , reported to Governor-General Ramón Blanco y Erenas the mysterious activities of certain Filipinos who had been gathering arms and recruiting men for some unknown purposes .
the Katipunan was finally discovered by the Spanish authorities six days after Fernández &apos;s letter to Luengo .
on early August 1896 , two Katipuneros , namely Teodoro Patiño and Apolonio de la Cruz , who were working for the Diario de Manila printing press ( leading newspaper during those times ) had undergone misunderstanding regarding wages .
as an action against de la Cruz , Patiño revealed the secrets of the society to his sister , Honoria Patiño , an inmate nun at the Mandaluyong Orphanage .
that afternoon , on August 19 , 1896 , Honoria grew shocked and very upset to the revelation .
the mother portress of the Orphanage , Sor Teresa de Jesus saw Honoria crying so she approached her .
Honoria told everything she heard from her brother .
at around 6 : 15 pm that day , Sor Teresa called Teodoro Patiño and advised him to tell everything he knew about the Katipunan through confession to Father Mariano Gíl .
controlled by his fear of Hell , Teodoro went to Father Mariano Gíl , an Augustinian parish curate of the Tondo convent .
though he is willed to tell anything about the Katipunan , Teodoro confessed to Father Gíl that a lithographic stone was hidden in the press-room of Diario de Manila , which was used by the society for printing receipts .
he also said that aside from the stone , there were also documents of membership ( that uses member &apos;s blood for signing ) hidden , together with a picture of Dr.
José Rizal and several daggers that was made for the katipunero-employees of the newspaper .
alarmed by the stunning truth of existence of a secret society , Father Gíl , accompanied by local Spanish authorities , searched the printing office of Diario de Manila and found the incriminating evidence .
they also found Apolonio de la Cruz in possession of a dagger used in Katipunan initiation rites and some list of new accepted members .
after the arrest , Father Gíl rushed to Governor-General Blanco to denounce the revolutionary plot of the Katipunan .
the Spanish unleashed a crackdown and arrested dozens of people , where many innocent citizens were forced to go to Fort Santiago .
Patiño &apos;s alleged betrayal has become the standard version of how the revolution broke out in 1896 .
in the 1920s , however , the Philippine National Library commissioned a group of former Katipuneros to confirm the truth of the story .
José Turiano Santiago , Bonifacio &apos;s close friend who was expelled in 1895 , denied the story .
he claimed that Bonifacio himself ordered Patiño to divulge the society &apos;s existence to hasten the Philippine revolution and preempt any objection from members .
Honoria , an orphanage inmate , was upset at the news and informed Sor Teresa , the orphanage madre portera , who suggested that Patiño tell all to Father Mariano Gil .
on August 19 , Patiño told Father Mariano what he knew of the secret society .
father Mariano and the owner of the Diario de Manila searched the printing shop , discovering the lithographic stone used to print pring Katipunan receipts .
after this discovery the locker of Policarpio Turla , whose signature appeared on the receipts , was forced open and found to contain a dagger , the rules of the society , and other pertinent documents .
these were turned over to the police , leading to the arrest and conviction on charges of illegal association and treason of some 500 prominent men .
in another version , the existence of the Katipunan eventually became known to the authorities through Teodoro Patiño , who revealed it to the Spaniard La Font , general manager of the printing shop Diario de Manila .
: 29 – 31 Patiño was engaged in a bitter dispute over pay with a co-worker , Katipunero Apolonio de la Cruz , and exposed the Katipunan in revenge .
: 30 – 31 La Font led a Spanish police lieutenant to the shop and the desk of Apolonio , where they &quot; found Katipunan paraphernalia such as a rubber stamp , a little book , ledgers , membership oaths signed in blood , and a membership roster of the Maghiganti chapter of the Katipunan .
from August 24 , 1896 , the Katipunan became an open insurgent government , and regarded themselves as a genuine government .
even though the society did have a unified structure , own laws and a centralized leadership , it turned to be working only when the revolution began .
&#91; clarification needed What is this sentence trying to say ? &#93; .
when the Katipunan leaders learned of the arrests , Bonifacio called an assembly of all provincial councils to decide the start of the armed uprising .
the meeting was held at the house of Apolonio Samson at a place called Kangkong in Balintawak .
about 1,000 Katipuneros attended the meeting but they were not able to settle the issue .
they met again at another place in Balintawak the following day .
historians are still debating whether this event took place at the yard of Melchora Aquino or at the house of her son Juan Ramos .
the meeting took place either on August 23 or August 24 .
: 35 It was at this second meeting where the Katipuneros in attendance decided to start the armed uprising and they tore their cedulas ( residence certificates and identity papers ) as a sign of their commitment to the revolution .
the Katipuneros also agreed to attack Manila on August 29 .
but Spanish civil guards discovered the meeting and the first battle occurred with the Battle of Pasong Tamo .
while the Katipunan initially had the upper hand , the Spanish civil guards turned the fight around .
Bonifacio and his men retreated toward Marikina via Balara ( now in Quezon City ) .
they then proceeded to San Mateo ( in the province now called Rizal ) and took the town .
the Spanish , however , regained it three days later .
after regrouping , the Katipuneros decided not to attack Manila directly but agreed to take the Spanish powder magazine and garrison at San Juan .
on August 30 , the Katipunan attacked the 100 Spanish soldiers defending the powder magazine in the Battle of San Juan del Monte or Battle of Pinaglabanan .
about 153 Katipuneros were killed in the battle , but the Katipunan had to withdraw upon the arrival of Spanish reinforcements .
more than 200 were taken prisoner .
Camilo de Polavieja declared martial law in Manila and the provinces of Cavite , Laguna , Batangas , Bulacan , Pampanga , Tarlac and Nueva Ecija .
in Bulacan , the Bulacan Revolutionary Movement were attacked by the strongest artillery forces ever converged in the capital town of Bulacan .
likewise , it is on this site where the &apos; Republic of Real de Kakarong de Sili &apos; of 1896 , one of the first Philippine revolutionary republics was established .
history and researchers , as well as records of the National Historical Commission , tells that the &apos; Kakarong Republic &apos; was the first and truly organized revolutionary government established in the country to overthrow the Spaniards antedating event the famous Malolos Republic and the Biak-na-Bato Republic .
in recognition thereof , these three &quot; Republics &quot; established in Bulacan have been incorporated in the seal of the province of Bulacan .
according to available records including the biography of General Gregorio del Pilar entitled Life and Death of a Boy General written by Teodoro Kalaw , former director of the National Library of the Philippines , a fort was constructed at &apos; Kakarong de Sili &apos; that was like a miniature city .
it had streets , an independent police force , a musical band , a factory of falconets , bolos and repair shops for rifles and cartridges .
the &apos; Kakarong Republic &apos; had a complete set of officials with Canuto Villanueva as Supreme Chief and &apos; Maestrong Sebio &apos; — Eusebio Roque as Brigadaire General of the Army .
the fort was attacked and totally destroyed on January 1 , 1897 by a large Spanish force headed by the Commandant Olaguer-Feliu .
Gregorio del Pilar was only a lieutenant at that time and &apos; The Battle of Kakarong de Sili &apos; was his first &quot; baptism of fire .
&quot; this was where he was first wounded and escaped to nearby barangay &apos; Manatal .
the Kakarong Lodge No .
168 of the &apos; Legionarios del Trabajo &apos; in memory of the 1,200 Katipuneros who perished in the battle erected a monument of the Inang Filipina Shrine – ( Mother Philippines Shrine ) in 1924 in the barrio of Kakarong of Pandi , Bulacan .
the actual site of the &apos; Battle of Kakarong de Sili &apos; is now a part of the barangay of &apos; Real de Kakarong &apos; .
no less than one of the greatest generals in the Philippines &apos; history , General Emilio Aguinaldo who became first Philippine president visited this sacred ground in the late fifties .
even before the discovery of the Katipunan , Rizal applied for a position as doctor in the Spanish army in Cuba in a bid to persuade the Spanish authorities of his loyalty to Spain .
his application was accepted and he arrived in Manila to board a ship for Spain in August 1896 , shortly before the secret society was exposed .
but while Rizal was en route to Spain , the Katipunan was unmasked and a telegram overtook the steamer at Port Said , recalling him to the Philippines to face charges that he was the mastermind of the uprising .
he was later executed by musketry on December 30 , 1896 at the field of Bagumbayan ( now known as Luneta ) .
six days later , they also executed the Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite at Fort San Felipe Fort in Cavite .
the Bicol Martyrs were executed by firing squad on January 4 , 1897 at Bagumbayan .
they were Manuel Abella , Domingo Abella , priests Inocencio Herrera , Gabriel Prieto and Severino Díaz , Camio Jacob , Tomas Prieto , Florencio Lerma , Macario Valentin , Cornelio Mercado and Mariano Melgarejo .
at a convention in Tejeros , Cavite , the revolutionaries assembled to form a revolutionary government .
there , Bonifacio lost his bid for the presidency of the revolutionary government to Emilio Aguinaldo , who was in Pasong Santol , fighting the Spanish forces and instead was elected Secretary of the Interior .
despite this , Aguinaldo took his oath of office as president the next day in Santa Cruz de Malabon ( present-day Tanza ) in Cavite , as did the rest of the officers , except for Bonifacio .

the Filipino value system or Filipino values refers to the set of values or the value system that a majority of the Filipino have historically held important in their lives .
this Philippine value system includes their own unique assemblage of consistent ideologies , moral codes , ethical practices , etiquette , and cultural and personal values that are promoted by their society .
according to the anthropologist Leonardo Mercado , the Filipino worldview is basically &apos; nondualistic &apos; .
Florentino Timbreza , a cultural philosopher , concludes in his book Pilosopiyang Pilipino ( 1982 ) that Filipino values are based on the significance of the world to man .
the first is the exogenous model or the foreign model , while the second is the indigenous model or the traditional model .
the foreign model is described to be a &quot; legal and formal &quot; model .
the foreign model was inherited by Filipinos from Western cultures , particularly from the Spaniards and the Americans .
an example of a foreign or exogenous influence is bureaucracy exhibited in the government of the Philippines .
Filipinos over the years have proven time and time again that they are a people with an industrious attitude .
foreigners who come to visit the Philippines speak of Filipinos going out of their way to help them when lost , or the heartwarming generosity of a Filipino family hosting a visitor in their poverty-stricken home .
meanwhile , most foreigners who attend Filipino gatherings abroad ( which are frequently organized for hundreds of reasons ) testify to the warmth and friendliness of Filipinos as they experience that feeling of “ belongingness .
” Indeed , the legendary Filipino hospitality is not limited to the Philippines .
it is everywhere wherever there are Filipinos .

for example , a company that manufactures and sells automobiles would record the revenue from the sale of an automobile as &quot; regular &quot; revenue .
conversely , high net income growth would be tainted if a company failed to produce significant revenue growth .
consistent revenue growth , if accompanied by net income growth , contributes to the value of an enterprise and therefore the stock price .
revenue is used as an indication of earnings quality .
there are several financial ratios attached to it , the most important being gross margin and profit margin .
also , companies use revenue to determine bad debt expense using the income statement method .
price / Sales is sometimes used as a substitute for a Price to earnings ratio when earnings are negative and the P / E is meaningless .
though a company may have negative earnings , it almost always has positive revenue .

in the 7th century Muslims conquered Syria ( including Jerusalem ) , North Africa and Spain .

Anglicanism was established in England in 1534 .
the Thirty Years &apos; War , the English Civil War , and the French Wars of Religion are prominent examples .
these events intensified the Christian debate on persecution and toleration .
in the era known as the Great Divergence , when in the West the Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific revolution brought about great societal changes , Christianity was confronted with various forms of skepticism and with certain modern political ideologies such as versions of socialism and liberalism .
events ranged from mere anti-clericalism to violent outbursts against Christianity such as the Dechristianisation during the French Revolution , the Spanish Civil War , and general hostility of Marxist movements , especially the Russian Revolution .
especially pressing in Europe was the formation of nation states after the Napoleonic era .
in all European countries , different Christian denominations found themselves in competition , to greater or lesser extents , with each other and with the state .
variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious , political , and ideological orientation of the state .

the Nicene Creed is &quot; accepted as authoritative by the Roman Catholic , Eastern Orthodox , Anglican , and major Protestant churches .
there is a diversity of doctrines and practices among groups calling themselves Christian .
these groups are sometimes classified under denominations , though for theological reasons many groups reject this classification system .
a broader distinction that is sometimes drawn is between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity , which has its origins in the East – West Schism ( Great Schism ) of the 11th century .
in addition to the Lutheran and Reformed ( or Calvinist ) branches of the Reformation , there is Anglicanism after the English Reformation .
the Anabaptist tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time , but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history .
Adventist , Baptist , Methodist , Pentecostal and other Protestant confessions arose in the following centuries .
as well as these modern divisions , there were many diverse Christian communities with wildly different Christologies , eschatologies , soteriologies , and cosmologies that existed alongside the &quot; Early Church &quot; which is itself a projected concept to indicate which communities were &quot; proto-orthodox &quot; , in that their views would become dominate .
in many ways , the first three centuries of Christianity was significantly more diverse than the modern Church .
the Catholic Church consists of those particular Churches , headed by bishops , in communion with the Pope , the Bishop of Rome , as its highest authority in matters of faith , morality and Church governance .
like Eastern Orthodoxy , the Roman Catholic Church , through apostolic succession , traces its origins to the Christian community founded by Jesus Christ .
another frequent application of the term is to distinguish political groups in areas of mixed religious backgrounds .
Christian groups and denominations have long expressed ideals of being reconciled , and in the 20th century , Christian ecumenism advanced in two ways .
the other way was institutional union with United and uniting churches , a practice that can be traced back to unions between Lutherans and Calvinists in early 19th-century Germany .
Congregationalist , Methodist and Presbyterian churches united in 1925 to form the United Church of Canada , and in 1977 to form the Uniting Church in Australia .

further investigations — such as blood tests , X-rays , and cultures — are usually not needed .
as croup worsens , stridor may decrease considerably .
other symptoms include fever , coryza ( symptoms typical of the common cold ) , and indrawing of the chest wall – known as Hoover &apos;s sign .
drooling or a very sick appearance indicate other medical conditions , such as epiglottitis .
croup is usually deemed to be due to a viral infection .
others use the term more broadly , to include acute laryngotracheitis , spasmodic croup , laryngeal diphtheria , bacterial tracheitis , laryngotracheobronchitis , and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis .
the first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology ; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity .
viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus ( a member of the paramyxovirus family ) , primarily types 1 and 2 , in 75 % of cases .
other viral causes include influenza A and B , measles , adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .
spasmodic croup is caused by the same group of viruses as acute laryngotracheitis , but lacks the usual signs of infection ( such as fever , sore throat , and increased white blood cell count ) .
treatment , and response to treatment , are also similar .
bacterial croup may be divided into laryngeal diphtheria , bacterial tracheitis , laryngotracheobronchitis , and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis .
laryngeal diphtheria is due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae while bacterial tracheitis , laryngotracheobronchitis , and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually due to a primary viral infection with secondary bacterial growth .
the most common bacteria implicated are Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Hemophilus influenzae , and Moraxella catarrhalis .
the most commonly used system for classifying the severity of croup is the Westley score .
it is primarily used for research purposes rather than in clinical practice .
it is the sum of points assigned for five factors : level of consciousness , cyanosis , stridor , air entry , and retractions .
the points given for each factor is listed in the adjacent table , and the final score ranges from 0 to 17 .
85 % of children presenting to the emergency department have mild disease ; severe croup is rare ( &lt; 1 % ) .
many cases of croup have been prevented by immunization for influenza and diphtheria .
at one time , croup referred to a diphtherial disease , but with vaccination , diphtheria is now rare in the developed world .
children with croup are generally kept as calm as possible .
steroids are given routinely , with epinephrine used in severe cases .
children with oxygen saturations under 92 % should receive oxygen , and those with severe croup may be hospitalized for observation .
with treatment , less than 0 .

6 mg / kg appear to be all equally effective .
while epinephrine typically produces a reduction in croup severity within 10 – 30 minutes , the benefits last for only about 2 hours .
if the condition remains improved for 2 – 4 hours after treatment and no other complications arise , the child is typically discharged from the hospital .
while other treatments for croup have been studied , none have sufficient evidence to support their use .
inhalation of hot steam or humidified air is a traditional self-care treatment , but clinical studies have failed to show effectiveness and currently it is rarely used .
the use of cough medicines , which usually contain dextromethorphan and / or guaifenesin , are also discouraged .
while breathing heliox ( a mixture of helium and oxygen ) to decrease the work of breathing has been used in the past , there is very little evidence to support its use .
since croup is usually a viral disease , antibiotics are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected .
in cases of possible secondary bacterial infection , the antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended .
in severe cases associated with influenza A or B , the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors may be administered .
symptoms usually improve within two days , but may last for up to seven days .
croup affects about 15 % of children , and usually presents between the ages of 6 months and 5 – 6 years .
it accounts for about 5 % of hospital admissions in this population .
in rare cases , it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years .
males are affected 50 % more frequently than are females , and there is an increased prevalence in autumn .
the word croup comes from the Early Modern English verb croup , meaning &quot; to cry hoarsely &quot; ; the name was first applied to the disease in Scotland and popularized in the 18th century .
the award was created by Joint Resolution No .

at the age of twenty , Febvre went to Paris to enrol in the École Normale Supérieure .
between 1899 and 1902 , he concentrated on studying history and geography .
after his graduation from college , Febvre taught at a provincial lycée , where he worked on his thesis on Philip II of Spain and the Franche-Comté .
later , Febvre &apos;s work would be a paradigm for the &quot; Annales School &quot; and would become a new way of historical thinking .
another influential work of Febvre dealt with Protestantism .
published in the Revue Historique in 1929 , &quot; Une question mal posée &quot; attempted to study popular religion by trying to observe and quantify human behavior .
through an enormous amount of research , Febvre collected information from various monasteries and chapels to study the influence of new wave philosophy in religion and the clergy &apos;s approach to understanding and translating their views to lay people .
through this work , Febvre became very involved in the field of ethnology , a field of study that quantifies human behavior .
some critics consider this work to be heavily influenced by Febvre &apos;s own views of the surrounding world .
as time went by , Febvre grew increasingly suspicious of theology .
he refused to see people as bound by forces beyond their control .
he came to the view that religion and old ways of thinking were impractical , maybe even dangerous , in modern times .
&quot; in the general confusion of our time , &quot; Febvre wrote , &quot; old ideas refuse to die and still find acceptance with the mass of the population .
&quot; he became convinced that changing religious views and attitudes is as difficult as trying to influence the outcome of any sort of political or social upheavals .
he believed that people needed to be educated in order to avoid the dangers of the old ways of thinking .
in 1933 Febvre was appointed to a chair at the Collège de France .
Febvre died in 1956 in Saint-Amour , France .

in tetrapod anatomy , lumbar is an adjective that means of or pertaining to the abdominal segment of the torso , between the diaphragm and the sacrum .
the lumbar region is sometimes referred to as the lower spine , or as an area of the back in its proximity .
in human anatomy the five vertebrae in the lumbar region of the back are the largest and strongest in the movable part of the spinal column , and can be distinguished by the absence of a foramen in the transverse process , and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body .
in most mammals , the lumbar region of the spine curves outward .
the actual spinal cord ( Angelamedulla spinalis ) terminates between vertebrae one and two of this series , called L1 and L2 .
the nervous tissue that extends below this point are individual strands that collectively form the cauda equina .
in between each lumbar vertebra a nerve root exits , and these nerve roots come together again to form the largest single nerve in the human body , the sciatic nerve .
the sciatic nerve runs through the back of each leg and into the feet .
this is why a disorder of the low back that affects a nerve root , such as a spinal disc herniation , can cause pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve ( sciatica ) down into the foot .
there are several muscles in the low back that assist with rotation , flexibility and strength .
these muscles are susceptible to injury , especially while lifting heavy objects , or lifting while twisting .
a low back muscle strain can be extremely painful but will usually heal within a few days or weeks .
the lumbar portion of the spine bears the most body weight and also provides the most flexibility , a combination that makes it susceptible to injury and wear and tear over time .

Madlax ( マドラックス , Madorakkusu ? ) is a 26-episode Japanese anime television series produced in 2004 by the Bee Train animation studio .
Kōichi Mashimo directed Madlax and the soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura .
the DVD version was released by ADV Films in North America and the United Kingdom and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand .
the story revolves around two young women who seemingly have little in common and do not know of the other &apos;s existence at the beginning .
the eponymous Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika , who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago , when the war started .
the other main character is Margaret Burton , the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece .
twelve years before the story begins , an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika , and its passengers , as well as Margaret &apos;s father who led the rescuers , have been missing ever since .
Margaret , however , mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own , losing her memories prior to her return ; the only thing she recalls is a single word , &quot; Madlax &quot; .
with this thread linking the two girls , they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them .
Madlax was produced as a spiritual successor to the studio &apos;s earlier project , Noir , and together with El Cazador de la Bruja , these series constitute a trilogy exploring the &quot; girls-with-guns &quot; genre .
the production of Madlax began in 2002 but it wasn &apos;t until Yōsuke Kuroda joined the project that the series took its final form .
while the critics noted the resulting similarities between Noir and Madlax , they also acknowledged the differences , such as the latter &apos;s less episodic and more plot-driven style and , in particular contrast to the predominantly realistic Noir , incorporation of many supernatural elements , which the audience must often interpret without further explanation .
the first half of the series alternates between the two leads .
Madlax is one of the most efficient special ops agents for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika , while Margaret Burton is a sleepy , clumsy amnesiac living in Nafrece , a country styled after France .
when a &quot; picture book &quot; , presumably given to Margaret by her late father , attracts the attention of international criminal network Enfant , she discovers that the origins of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika .
Enfant &apos;s top operative , Carrossea Doon , tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction , towards Madlax , who has been causing Enfant trouble for some time .
meanwhile , Vanessa Rene , Margaret &apos;s former tutor whose parents died because of Gazth-Sonikan war , discovers that her current employer , Bookwald Industries , covertly supports the war by supplying both sides with firearms and starts investigating its true cause .
her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika , where Madlax is hired as her bodyguard , and together , they uncover data that proves that Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict .
Enfant eventually intercepts them and they are forced into hiding .
back in Nafrece , Margaret decides to help Vanessa and travels to Gazth-Sonika , accompanied by her devoted and sometimes overprotective maid Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon .
eventually , Madlax and Margaret meet and embark on a search for Quanzitta Marison , a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who supposedly knows about Margaret &apos;s book , Enfant &apos;s involvement with it , and Enfant itself .
Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war , starting with Gazth-Sonika .
she reveals that Enfant &apos;s leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books , one of which belongs to Margaret .
Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories .
Carrossea , who has been aiding Margaret , requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so ; he discovers that he , in fact , died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret .
Carrossea disappears , and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans .
while Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual , Madlax is attacked by Limelda Jorg , a Gazth-Sonikan sniper who holds a grudge against Madlax ever since she failed to stop an assassination by Madlax earlier in the show .
Limelda kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax , sending the latter into clinical depression .
Elenore and Lady Quanzitta &apos;s servant Nakhl manage to restore Madlax &apos;s will to live and persuade her to save Margaret , and the three storm Enfant &apos;s headquarters together .
during the assault , Elenore is killed and Margaret , now under Monday &apos;s control , shoots Madlax .
believing her to be dead , Monday commences a ritual to unleash people &apos;s inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy ; but Margaret &apos;s memories return and she snaps out of his mind control .
only now does the audience learn the back-story : back in 1999 , Monday drove Margaret &apos;s father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own father .
to escape the horrible truth of her patricide , Margaret split herself into three personae : the &quot; memory keeper &quot; Laetitia , the sinful Madlax , and the innocent Margaret herself .
Margaret then fuses her three personae back together to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday , saving the world from insanity .
Madlax , who should no longer exist after the fusion , appears and guns down Monday .
it becomes apparent that Margaret has once again split herself into three , judging that after twelve years , she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae .
Madlax is set against the backdrop of Gazth-Sonikan war and the first episodes contrast the tranquil Nafrece with the war-torn Gazth-Sonika ; later , the story moves completely to the combat zone , focusing on the central characters , such as Limelda Jorg , and their suffering .
in an interview , the director Mashimo stated that &quot; &#91; t &#93; he story is about portraying inner struggles of people , while showing what life is like in this place of madness and this other place of peace &quot; .
accordingly , the series &apos; title is a portmanteau of two English words , &quot; mad &quot; and &quot; relaxed &quot; , mirroring the authors &apos; intention to portray the two extremes of human being .
Madlax also plays as the story of Margaret Burton &apos;s search for her psychological identity .
based on the Mashimo Menu theme titles available to her , Yuki Kajiura has suggested an interpretation that while searching for her memories , Margaret meets the other characters ( &quot; Gatekeepers &quot; ) one after another and learns about the lifestyles ( &quot; Gates &quot; ) they represent .
in the end , she finds her own &quot; Gate &quot; , which is the new identity that finally replaces the one she lost twelve years ago .
according to the director Kōichi Mashimo , he envisioned Noir and Madlax as part of a trilogy exploring the girls-with-guns genre , and soon after the release of the latter , he confirmed having plans to produce the third installment , which would later become El Cazador de la Bruja .
in late 2002 , Mashimo invited Shigeru Kitayama , the producer of Noir who once came up with its original idea , to discuss a new series entitled Madlax .
Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo &apos;s original screenplay plan , but it was not until Yōsuke Kuroda was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance .
it took Kuroda around one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes , during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan .
Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo &apos;s invitation , he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher , so he decided to make Madlax &quot; really extravagant &quot; , blending as many genres at once as he could .
Kōichi Mashimo , furthermore , admitted that the most unusual plot twists , like Margaret and Madlax &apos;s connection to each other , were invented by Kuroda and him while drunk .
by comparison with Noir , Madlax features a much larger primary cast , including multiple recurring male characters , an element nearly absent in the former .
it was not so in the original screenplay draft written by Mashimo and Kitayama : for example , &quot; Madlax &quot; was Margaret &apos;s own nickname and Charlie ( Vanessa &apos;s colleague at Bookwald Industries ) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy &apos;s in Avenger .
only the &quot; draft &quot; characters &apos; names remained of them when Kuroda has rewritten the script .
a total of three character designers collaborated on Madlax cast : Satoshi Ohsawa ( who also worked on Noir cast ) created the central heroines Margaret and Madlax ; Minako Shiba drew Friday Monday and Carrossea Doon ; and Satoko Miyachi was entrusted with the &quot; mysterious &quot; characters , Laetitia and Poupee .
as with many of studio Bee Train &apos;s other works , the entire Madlax soundtrack was composed by the acclaimed Yuki Kajiura , making it her and Kōichi Mashimo &apos;s fifth project together .
in an interview Kajiura recalls having written the score in a hotel high-rise to save studio costs , and that this change in location helped her to explore different styles of music .
Kajiura and Yuuka Nanri &apos;s duo FictionJunction Yuuka recorded the series &apos; opening and ending themes , &quot; Fragments of an Eye &quot; ( 瞳の欠片 , Hitomi no Kakera ? ) and &quot; Inside Your Heart &quot; , respectively , as well as two insert songs : &quot; nowhere &quot; and &quot; I &apos;m here &quot; .
aside from the opening sequence , &quot; Fragments of an Eye &quot; is featured in the series itself : at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24 , when Margaret is humming its tune to herself in the flower field .
in the insert song &quot; nowhere &quot; , there is a frequently repeated background refrain &quot; Yanmaani &quot; ( ヤンマーニ , Yanmāni ? ) .
it doesn &apos;t have any particular meaning but since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting , &quot; Yanmaani &quot; has become something of a joke to Japanese fans , claiming that it apparently gives her superpowers .
originally , Madlax was broadcast in Japan by TV Tokyo from 5 April to 27 September 2004 , from 1 : 30 to 2 : 00 a .
every Tuesday ( formally , Monday night ) .
shortly before the series finished airing , it has been licensed in North America and Europe by ADV Films , which has previously acquired distribution rights for Noir and has long had plans to license its successor , as well .
the official English dub has been released in the United States under the trademark MADLAX on a total of seven DVDs from 12 April 2005 to 28 March 2006 .
a complete collection was released by ADV on 17 July 2007 .
Madlax has become the first series on which ADV Films &apos; director and producer David Williams tested the technology of distributing promotional materials via P2P network BitTorrent .
as of September 1 , 2009 , all of the titles from ADV &apos;s catalog , including Madlax , were transferred to AEsir Holdings , with distribution from Section23 Films .
the North-American DVD release contains extras available in English only , such the controversial self-parody Conversations with SSS and Sock Puppet Theater , an Easter egg live action about Madlax going after Chris Patton , Badgis &apos; voice actor and an annoying womanizer .
on 7 February 2006 , the first episode of Madlax aired on Anime Network ( which was , like ADV Films , a subsidiary of A.
on 4 April , shortly after the last DVD volume has been released , the consequent broadcast was put on halt and until 27 June , only the first 8 episodes were repeated .
since then , the series has been relaunched multiple times .
Madman Entertainment , who previously licensed Noir in its region , has acquired rights for distribution of Madlax in Australia and New Zealand and released it on seven DVD volumes between 20 July 2005 and 26 July 2006 .
a complete collection was released on 4 April 2007 .
the series &apos; original soundtrack was released on two albums on 21 July and 22 September 2004 by Victor Entertainment .
two singles , Hitomi no Kakera and Inside Your Heart , were published in the same year by FictionJunction Yuuka , each containing an opening / ending theme and one insert song , as well as their respective karaoke versions .
Madlax the Bible is a 95-page artbook that was published in Japan on 21 May 2005 by Hobby Japan .
aside from illustrations and artworks for the series , it contains interviews with its authors and voice actors , as well as diverse additional information about the show in Japanese .
the artbook has never been published outside Japan .
since the word &quot; Bible &quot; is derived from Ancient Greek : τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια , meaning &quot; holy books &quot; , it is likely that the artbook &apos;s title is a reference to the Holy Books that play an important role in the series &apos; plot .
a resin model kit known as &quot; Madlax with Guns &quot; has been produced , featuring a figurine of Madlax dual wielding her signature SIG P210s .
a polystone figurine entitled simply &quot; Madlax &quot; , was launched in August 2007 .
in Japan , a T-shirt with Madlax logo has been added to the limited edition of the first DVD volume , and the &quot; first press &quot; of the OST albums came with logotype mousepads .
Madlax was often accused of being secondary and reusing Noir &apos;s stylistic solutions , such as the story premise , the two heroines &apos; appearance , and the musical style .
nevertheless , some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor &apos;s , owing to all its episodes and subplots being tightly intertwined and held together by the primary plot .
the majority of reviewers perceived the early episodes of Madlax as boring and too slow-paced , but some of the same critics later remarked that the prolonged exposition is crucial to the unusual finale of the series , which fully establishes the series &apos; own identity and sets it apart from other works .
according to them , after the initial volume , the story gets better and better with every new episode , though some have been dissatisfied with its &quot; pseudo-existentialistic &quot; ending .
Erica Friedman , the president of Yuricon , highly praised Kuroda &apos;s script , naming it &quot; the best writing that Bee Train has done &quot; .
professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters , especially the distinguishable male ones ( Friday , Carrossea , Colonel Burton ) , as opposed to stormtrooper-like operatives of Soldats in Noir , but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed ( to the point of fanservice in the case of Madlax ) than the more generic male characters .
the high quality of the animation in Madlax was generally acknowledged .
on the negative side , the episodes that involve computer use and hacking received criticism for their lack of realism .
in terms of soundtrack , Madlax has not become as innovative as Noir , with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of Noir and .
hack / / Sign styles .
nevertheless , the reviewers acknowledged its superiority over the majority of contemporary works .
the English translation released by ADV Films was praised for preserving most of the series &apos; original stylistic aspects and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub .
reviewers went as far as to suggest that several English voices ( especially Mike Kleinhenz &apos;s ) match the characters better than the Japanese ones .
others , however , criticized the dub , e .
Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network in his 2009 review of the series rated the performance as &quot; wildly uneven , ranging from good .
to plain amateurish &quot; , citing &quot; delivery issues &quot; as main problem of the dub .
the initial slow pacing , especially compared to the first episodes of Noir , became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching Madlax before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series .
among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were : the market saturation , which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of Noir since 2001 ; the expectable disinterest against a &quot; Noir remake &quot; , found among the fans of the first series ; the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous ; and its unconventional genre , which straddled Madlax uncomfortably between fans of mystical science fiction and those who prefer Noir &apos;s strict realism .

Mark J.
Blechner ( born November 6 , 1950 , in Manhattan , New York ) is an American psychologist and psychoanalyst .
dreams may contribute to the formation of new ideas .
Blechner &apos;s theory of &quot; Oneiric Darwinism &quot; ( oneiric , &quot; related to dreams &quot; ; Darwinism , &quot; a selectionist model of the creation of ideas &quot; ) proposes that some dreams create &quot; thought mutations &quot; – new ideas that can be developed if useful , or discarded if useless or maladaptive , much as Darwinian evolutionary theory proposes that genetic mutations can lead to improved survival .
most people dream five or more times per night , although few of those dreams are remembered .
Oneiric Darwinism proposes a function for the majority of dreams of which we are never aware or do not remember .
Blechner has argued that the most anxiety-provoking interpretations of dreams may result from asking the dreamer : &quot; have you ever experienced what happened in the dream or something like it ? &quot; he has proposed that in dreams , we see the operation of the brain producing meaning that does not need to be communicable .
this leads to phenomena like predicates with omitted subjects , similar to inner speech and pictorialized metaphors , that can make dreams difficult to understand .
in the 1980s , Blechner specialized in the psychological issues of people with AIDS .
he founded , at the William Alanson White Institute , the first psychoanalytic clinic specializing in the psychological treatment of people with HIV and their caregivers .
Blechner also studied issues of sexuality , gender , and sexual orientation .
he has studied the unconscious biases and fears about masculinity and femininity , and their variation across cultures and time periods .
he has noted the malleability of concepts of perversion , which included masturbation in the 19th century and oral sex in the early 20th century , and sought the removal of stigma and the diagnosis of psychopathology of behaviors that are consensual and do not harm another person .
he has studied the rules of irrational thinking that underlie prejudices against groups based on race , religion , and sexual orientation .
he links the fear of same-sex marriage to the &quot; von Domarus principle &quot; by which things that are merely associated with one another are seen to have a causal relationship .
for example , a schizophrenic may think , &quot; If my mother &apos;s name is Mary , and Mary is the mother of God , then I am God .
&quot; when under great emotional pressure , most people are capable of this sort of irrational reasoning .

Maureen &quot; Mau &quot; Flores Marcelo ( born May 13 , 1980 ) is a Filipino soul singer who rose to prominence as the first winner of Philippine Idol in 2006 .
she was dubbed as the &quot; Soul Idol &quot; and &quot; The Black Belter &quot; at the competition for her R &amp; B-style vocals .
she was also called &quot; Philippines &apos; Diamond Diva &quot; after her much-applauded performance of &quot; Diamonds Are Forever &quot; by Shirley Bassey during the Movie and Musical Theme Week .
she was also the Philippine representative to Asian Idol , which was held on December 15 and 16 , 2007 in Jakarta , Indonesia .
Marcelo &apos;s father is an American citizen from Puerto Rico while her mother is Filipina .
her father left the family when she was four months old , while her mother died when she was 14 .
she has a half-sister from her mother and two half-brothers and another half-sister from her father .
it was also the first time that she won .
she also learned to accept herself and her looks .
a year after her mother &apos;s death , Marcelo &apos;s father came into her life once more when he returned to the Philippines .
since then , they had constant communication even though her father lives in Atlanta with his own family .
she eventually graduated in Quezon National High School and attended college in Manuel S.
by her 20s , Marcelo became a veteran of singing competitions .
she joined her first national singing competition through Star for a Night , which was shown on IBC-13 .
she has also joined other televised singing competitions such as Star Quest at ABS-CBN &apos;s Magandang Tanghali Bayan and ABC-5 &apos;s Sing Galing .
in 2004 , Marcelo went to Singapore to gain foreign exposure in singing with the help of her stepsister &apos;s husband .
using her screen name &quot; Samantha Brown &quot; , she performed in various bars and has become popular with the city-state &apos;s Filipino community .
by the time Marcelo was about to audition for Philippine Idol , she won in over 200 amateur singing competitions .
she even joked in an interview that she had so many trophies in her house that she donated some of them to gay beauty pageants .
Marcelo tried out in Philippine Idol through a &quot; fast track &quot; screening held in SM City Lucena .
passing the fast track audition meant that she did not have to go through the numerous screenings of the main auditions .
she was contestant number 1646 during her auditions in Pasay City , wherein she sang Jaya Ramsey &apos;s &quot; Laging Naroon Ka &quot; ( You Were Always There ) .
her audition was not shown on Philippine Idol , although she appeared during the final phase of the theater eliminations singing &quot; How Am I Supposed to Live Without You &quot; by Laura Branigan .
despite her impressive auditions , Marcelo &apos;s journey through Philippine Idol was not easy .
she did not reach the Top 4 of the Women &apos;s Semi-finals and had to go through the Wildcard .
her confidence slowly started to dwindle to the point that she commented during the Wildcard Results Show , when there was only one finalist spot to fill , that Philippine Idol is a &quot; beauty contest &quot; .
her sarcastic yet tearful comment garnered laughter and applause from the audience , including Idol judge Ryan Cayabyab .
when her name was finally called as one of the finalists , Marcelo cried out loud on stage .
during competition , Marcelo &apos;s father had petitioned her to migrate to the United States .
Marcelo talked to him about what she was going through the competition .
he advised that she can continue with the contest , but would rather not see her getting hurt in the process .
she ultimately decided to continue .
Marcelo received immense fan support during Philippine Idol to the point that some of them even lent their services to her by giving her a total make-over from her choice of clothes , hairstyle , posture , and even her manner of speaking .
she even underwent a strict South Beach Diet and lost 12 pounds during the competition .
Marcelo received negative comments from the judges on her first two songs — namely &quot; Love Takes Time &quot; by Mariah Carey which was her personal choice and &quot; Balut &quot; by New Minstrels which was the judges &apos; choice — despite what appeared to be impressive performances .
she rebounded on her third song , &quot; Try It On My Own &quot; by Whitney Houston , which was the record company &apos;s choice and would become her &quot; victory song &quot; if ever she would win .
her final performance received a long standing ovation from the audience .
36 % of the total votes .
Marcelo &apos;s first solo concert was held in her hometown Lucena City on April 21 , 2007 , at Sentro Pastoral Auditorium .
she has yet to have a regular stint on TV , compared to Magdangal who became a talent for SOP Rules weeks after Philippine Idol .
Marcelo said that she is happy for him and not envious of his success .
Marcelo has two adopted children , Patricia ( born 2002 ) and Paolo ( born 2006 ) .
she was also part of the compilation album of Star for a Night .
following the success of her tilt as the first Philippine Idol CD-EP entitled On My Own was released on January 2 , 2007 by Sony BMG as part of her prize in Philippine Idol .
in late 2007 , a second album was also released Sony BMG as Marcelo &apos;s first full-length album for entitled I Shine For You .

the medulla oblongata ( or medulla ) is located in the hindbrain , anterior to the cerebellum .
it is a cone-shaped neuronal mass responsible for autonomic ( involuntary ) functions ranging from vomiting to sneezing .
the medulla contains the cardiac , respiratory , vomiting and vasomotor centers and therefore deals with the autonomic functions of breathing , heart rate and blood pressure .
the bulb is an archaic term for the medulla oblongata and in modern clinical usage the word bulbar ( as in bulbar palsy ) is retained for terms that relate to the medulla oblongata , particularly in reference to medical conditions .
the word bulbar can refer to the nerves and tracts connected to the medulla , and also by association to those muscles innervated , such as those of the tongue , pharynx and larynx .
the medulla can be thought of as being in two parts : .
the anterior median fissure contains a fold of pia mater , and extends along the length of the medulla oblongata .
it ends at the lower border of the pons in a small triangular area , termed the foramen cecum .
on either side of this fissure are raised areas termed the medullary pyramids .
the pyramids house the pyramidal tracts – the corticospinal and the corticobulbar tracts of the nervous system .
at the caudal part of the medulla these tracts cross over in the decussation of the pyramids obscuring the fissure at this point .
some other fibers that originate from the anterior median fissure above the decussation of the pyramids and run laterally across the surface of the pons are known as the anterior external arcuate fibers .
the region between the anterolateral and posterolateral sulcus in the upper part of the medulla is marked by a pair of swellings known as olivary bodies ( also called olives ) .
they are caused by the largest nuclei of the olivary bodies , the inferior olivary nuclei .
the posterior part of the medulla between the posterior median sulcus and the posterolateral sulcus contains tracts that enter it from the posterior funiculus of the spinal cord .
these are the gracile fasciculus , lying medially next to the midline , and the cuneate fasciculus , lying laterally .
these fasciculi end in rounded elevations known as the gracile and the cuneate tubercles .
they are caused by masses of gray matter known as the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus .
the soma ( cell bodies ) in these nuclei are the second-order neurons of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway , and their axons , called the internal arcuate fibers or fasciculi , decussate from one side of the medulla to the other to form the medial lemniscus .
just above the tubercles , the posterior aspect of the medulla is occupied by a triangular fossa , which forms the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle .
the fossa is bounded on either side by the inferior cerebellar peduncle , which connects the medulla to the cerebellum .
the lower part of the medulla , immediately lateral to the cuneate fasciculus , is marked by another longitudinal elevation known as the tuberculum cinereum .
it is caused by an underlying collection of gray matter known as the spinal trigeminal nucleus .
the gray matter of this nucleus is covered by a layer of nerve fibers that form the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve .
the base of the medulla is defined by the commissural fibers , crossing over from the ipsilateral side in the spinal cord to the contralateral side in the brain stem ; below this is the spinal cord .
blood to the medulla is supplied by a number of arteries .
the medulla oblongata forms in fetal development from the myelencephalon .
the final differentiation of the medulla is seen at week 20 gestation .
neuroblasts from the alar plate of the neural tube at this level will produce the sensory nuclei of the medulla .
the basal plate neuroblasts will give rise to the motor nuclei .
the medulla oblongata connects the higher levels of the brain to the spinal cord , and is responsible for several functions of the autonomous nervous system which include : .
a blood vessel blockage ( such as in a stroke ) will injure the pyramidal tract , medial lemniscus , and the hypoglossal nucleus .
this causes a syndrome called medial medullary syndrome .
lateral medullary syndrome can be caused by the blockage of either the posterior inferior cerebellar artery or of the vertebral arteries .
both lampreys and hagfish possess a fully developed medulla oblongata .
since these are both very similar to early agnathans , it has been suggested that the medulla evolved in these early fish , approximately 505 million years ago .
the status of the medulla as part of the primordial reptilian brain is confirmed by its disproportionate size in modern reptiles such as the crocodile , alligator , and monitor lizard .

Josephus records the false etymology that the Greek phrase Hyksos stood for the Egyptian phrase Hekw Shasu meaning the Shepherd Kings , which scholars have only recently shown means &quot; rulers of foreign lands .
in the Hebrew Bible , the term &quot; Hebrew &quot; is normally used by Israelites when speaking of themselves to foreigners , or is used by foreigners when speaking about Israelites .
in fact , the Torah in parashat Lekh Lekha ( &quot; go ! &quot; or &quot; leave ! &quot; , literally &quot; go for you &quot; ) calls Abraham Avram Ha-Ivri ( &quot; Abram the Hebrew &quot; ) , which translates literally as &quot; Abram the one who stands on the other side .
according to the Jewish Encyclopedia the terms &quot; Hebrews &quot; and &quot; Israelites &quot; usually describe the same people , stating that they were called Hebrews before the conquest of the Land of Canaan and Israelites afterwards .
among certain left-wing or liberal circles of Judaic cultural lineage , the word &quot; Hebrew &quot; is used as an alternatively secular description of the Jewish people ( e .
, Bernard Avishai &apos;s The Hebrew Republic or left-wing wishes for a &quot; Hebrew-Arab &quot; joint cultural republican state ) .
beginning in the late 19th century , the term &quot; Hebrew &quot; became popular among secular Zionists ; in this context the word alluded to the transformation of the Jews into a strong , independent , self-confident secular national group ( &quot; the New Jew &quot; ) sought by classical Zionism .
this use died out after the establishment of the state of Israel , when &quot; Hebrew &quot; was replaced with &quot; Jew &quot; or &quot; Israeli &quot; .
similarly , &quot; Hebrew Christians &quot; ( better known as Jewish Christians ) identify with their Hebrew ethnicity while often embracing adaptations of Protestantism or any other form of Christianity .

the Gardens of Vatican City ( Latin : Horti Civitatis Vaticanae ) also informally known as the Vatican Gardens ( Italian : Giardini Vaticani ) in Vatican City are private urban gardens and parks which cover more than half of the country , located in the west of the territory and is owned by the Pope .
there are some buildings , such as Radio Vatican , within the gardens .
the gardens cover approximately 23 hectares ( 57 acres ) which is most of the Vatican Hill .
the highest point is 60 metres ( 200 ft ) above mean sea level .
stone walls bound the area in the North , South and West .
the gardens and parks were established during the Renaissance and Baroque era and are decorated with fountains and sculptures .
there is no general public access , but guided tours are available to limited numbers .
the gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace .
in 1279 , Pope Nicholas III ( Giovanni Gaetano Orsini , 1277 – 1280 ) moved his residence back to the Vatican from the Lateran Palace and enclosed this area with walls .
he planted an orchard ( pomerium ) , a lawn ( pratellum ) and a garden ( viridarium ) .
the site received a major re-landscaping at the beginning of the 16th century , during the pontificate of Pope Julius II .
Donato Bramante &apos;s original design was then split into three new courtyards , the Cortili del Belvedere , the &quot; della Biblioteca &quot; and the &quot; della Pigna &quot; ( or Pine Cone ) in the Renaissance landscape design style .
also in Renaissance style , a great rectangular Labyrinth , formal in design , set in boxwood and framed with Italian stone pines , ( Pinus pinea ) and cedars of Lebanon , ( Cedrus libani ) .
in place of Nicholas III &apos;s enclosure , Bramante built a great rectilinear defensive wall .
today &apos;s Vatican Gardens are spread over nearly 23 hectares ( 57 acres ) , they contain a variety of medieval fortifications , buildings and monuments from the 9th century to the present day , set among vibrant flower beds and topiary , green lawns and a 3 hectares ( 7 .
4 acres ) patch of forest .

the Negrito peoples show strong physical similarities with the Pygmy peoples of Africa but are genetically closer to other Southeast Asian populations .
they may be descended from ancient Australoid-Melanesian settlers of Southeast Asia , or represent an early split from the southern coast migrants from Africa .
the word &quot; Negrito &quot; is the Spanish diminutive of negro , used to mean &quot; little black person &quot; .
the claim that the Andamanese more closely resemble African Pygmies than other Asian populations in their cranial morphology in a study of 1973 added some weight to this theory , before genetic studies pointed to a closer relationship with their neighbors .
multiple studies also show that Negritos from Southeast Asia to New Guinea share a closer cranial affinity with Australo-Melanesians .
according to both Wells and Mason , the Australoid Negritos , similar to the Andamanese adivasis of today , were the first identifiable human population to colonize India , likely 30 – 65 thousand years before present ( kybp ) .
this first colonization of the Indian mainland and the Andaman Islands by humans is theorized to be part of a great coastal migration of humans from Africa along the coastal regions of the Indian mainland and towards Southeast Asia , Japan and Oceania .
evidence of their former habitation is a Saisiyat festival celebrating the black people in a festival called Pas-ta &apos;ai .
ancient Mongoloid , Negrito , Indonesian , Melanesian , and Australoid remains have been found in Vietnam .

in particle physics , the X and Y bosons ( sometimes collectively called &quot; X bosons &quot; ) are hypothetical elementary particles analogous to the W and Z bosons , but corresponding to a new type of force predicted by the Georgi – Glashow model , a grand unified theory .
the X and Y bosons couple quarks to leptons , allowing violation of the conservation of baryon number , and thus permitting proton decay .
an X boson would have the following decay modes : .
where the two decay products in each process have opposite chirality , u is an up quark , d is a down antiquark and e + is a positron .
a Y boson would have the following decay modes : .
where the first decay product in each process has left-handed chirality and the second has right-handed chirality and ν e is an electron antineutrino .
similar decay products exist for the other quark-lepton generations .
in these reactions , neither the lepton number ( L ) nor the baryon number ( B ) is conserved , but B − L is .
different branching ratios between the X boson and its antiparticle ( as is the case with the K-meson ) would explain baryogenesis .

the following is a list of the 92 comuni of the Metropolitan city of Naples , Campania , in Italy .
the Senatorial districts of the Philippines were the representations of the provinces of the Philippines in the Philippine Senate from 1916 to 1935 .
the enactment of the Philippine Autonomy Act ( popularly known as &quot; Jones Law &quot; ) in August 1916 by the United States Congress provided for the creation of a bicameral legislature consisting of a lower chamber ( House of Representatives ) and an upper chamber ( Senate ) .
the system of government of the Philippines in its early years of transition to democratic self-government was deliberately structured to emulate the American model .
the Philippines thus followed the American system of electing the members of the 24-seat senate by district .
however , when the Constitution was amended in 1940 to re-establish a bicameral Congress , members of the Senate had to be voted at-large , thereby effectively abolishing the district system .

during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos , upon the mandate of the then 1973 Constitution , he changed the departments into ministries from 1978 to the end of his administration .
for example , the Department of Education became Ministry of Education , Culture and Sports .
all departments are listed by their present-day name with their English names on top and Filipino names at the bottom .
Department heads are listed at the Cabinet of the Philippines article .
AD 24 ( XXIV ) was a leap year starting on Saturday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar .
at the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Cethegus and Varro ( or , less frequently , year 777 Ab urbe condita ) .
the denomination AD 24 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .
it may be thought of as the equivalent of a cabinet .
the most populous top-level administrative unit in Vietnam is Hồ Chí Minh City , one of the five centrally governed cities .
it has 7,123,340 people living within its official boundaries .
in the late Muromachi period , however , their function was gradually supplanted by the domains of the sengoku daimyō .
the local daimyōs &apos; fiefs were developed .
in the Edo period , the fiefs became known as han .
Imperial provinces and shogunal domains made up complementary systems .
each province is governed by an elected legislature called the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and by an elected governor .
the American administration initially inherited the Spanish divisions and placed them under military government .
as insurgencies were pacified , civil government was gradually organized .
some parts of the numbering system are Admiral Dewey Boulevard ( Highway 1 ) , Calle Manila ( Highway 50 ) and 19 de Junio ( Highway 54 ) .
the Department of Public Works and Highways ( DPWH ) is the government agency that deals with these projects .
Expressway of the Philippines is composed of 10 expressways that connects Metro Manila to the provinces in the North Luzon and South Luzon .
as of now not all expressway are interconnected , with a plan in the future to connect all of the expressways to form a network .
the first expressway systems in the Philippines are the North Luzon Expressway , formerly known as North Diversion Road and the South Luzon Expressway ( SLEx ) , formerly known as South Super Highway .
both were built in the 1970s , during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos .
the first Elevated Toll Road in the Philippines is the Metro Manila Skyway or the South Metro Manila Skyway Project , built in 1995 to 1999 , during the presidency of Fidel Ramos and Joseph Estrada .
the STAR Tollway I , from Santo Tomas to Lipa , was opened in 2001 ; STAR Tollway II , from Lipa to the Batangas City Port , opened in 2008 .
the Subic – Clark – Tarlac Expressway or SCTEx Project was initiated under the administration of former President Joseph Estrada with an original project cost of ₱ 15 .
73 billion .
construction was started in 2005 under the government of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo .
it is the longest tollway in the Philippines that connects Subic , Clark and Tarlac .
it was completed with a project cost of ₱ 34 .
957 billion .
100 km / h for cars and jeepneys , 80 km / h for trucks and buses , and 60 km / h is the minimum for all classes of vehicles .
among the principal influences to the Filipina image of herself and to her writings we include four women in Philippine history , namely : Gabriela Silang , Leonor Rivera , Imelda Marcos and Corazon Aquino .
often mentioned in Philippine literature , these four represent the struggle , perception and character of how it is to be a woman in Philippine society .
Gabriela Silang was a katipunera or a revolutionary – a representation of female bravery – who fought against Spanish colonialism in the 18th century .
Silang was a contrast to the chaste and religiously devout image of the Filipino lady as portrayed by Jose Rizal through his Spanish-language novels , Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo .
Aquino , the first woman president in Asia and the Philippines – the elected 1986 replacement of a male despot , Ferdinand Marcos .
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo , after two male presidents ( Fidel V.
Ramos and Joseph Estrada , respectively ) , followed in the footsteps of Corazon Aquino to become a leader and political figure of an Asian nation .
in the latter years of modern-day Philippine literature , from the 1960s to the 1980s , feminism became the focus of Philippine women writers – first in poetry and then prose – in order to break away from what was termed the “ Great Grand Silence of the Centuries ” .
creating an image unique to themselves – through their own individual efforts – became the norm .
there was criticism against the Maria Clara image portrayed by the Philippine paladin , José Rizal , as well as critiques and femenine disapproval of how Filipino men writers wrote about women .
contemporary feminist female writers were also inclined to break away from the traditional , idealized and typecast image of the Filipina of the past as matriarchal mystics and figures who performed sacrifices , underwent suffrage and works of martyrdom which was to be expected , given their pious upbringing .
women writers also passed judgment against the typical portrayal of women as sex symbols .
among the first lady writers to break away from the old style and genre , exemplified in the works of past female writers , were Paz Latorena &apos;s traditional &quot; teachings &quot; about the ideal Filipina in the feminist poet , Marjorie Evasco .
an example is the 1992 publication of Forbidden Fruit , a bilingual volume combining Filipino and English language works of women .
contrary to the treatment received by Filipinos during the Spanish colonial period , the education of the Philippine citizenry was prioritized during the time of the American occupation , as seen in the activities of the Thomasites and U.
nevertheless , despite this lack of financial support for writers , many works in the Filipiniana style proliferated and were written dominantly in Philippine English , but fewer however saw print in the local maternal languages .
during the four-year Japanese occupation of the Philippines in the Second World War , the Japanese introduced the concept of “ Asia for Asians , ” an idea that halted the proliferation of English as the language of literature in the Philippines because it sparked the publication and media broadcasts with the exclusive use of the vernacular or the “ childhood languages ” of Filipinos .
this Japanese contribution to the Filipino ’ s linguistic enlightenment reawakened the already existing move to lift the status of local languages as forms of literary expression prior to the introduction and propagation of English in the Filipino archipelago .
the common “ languages of childhood ” of Filipinos , generally include Tagalog , Visayan , Hiligaynon , Cebuano and Ilocano , among others .
still , despite the Filipino ’ s reawakening of their “ languages of childhood ” , the status of the English language returned and was elevated .
the rejuvenation was due in part to the spread of English-based Philippine magazines in conjunction with the publication of serial “ romantic and melodramatic ” novels by women writers who wrote in their “ mother tongue ” through the pages of comics and magazines like Liwayway , Bannawag , Bulaklak , Aliwan and Tagumpay .
the competition between the use of English and Filipino as main modes of communication was unrelenting even after the end of World War II , the proclamation of Philippine Independence in 1946 , and the official adoption of Filipino as a second official language other than English in 1987 .
the persistence of this competitive phenomenon was due to the close economic , military and cultural association of the Philippines to the United States , the encouragement of the use of English in combination with the dialects in schools and universities , and the need to gain a larger audience of readership .
as a result , bilingualism - and even multilingualism - became the linguistic style and norm .
prior to the surge of Spanish conquerors and colonizers , Filipino women were already creating and recording poetry using perishable materials such as banana leaves .
indigenous Filipino women were also singing tribal songs at a time when they enjoyed equal status to their male counterparts .
born in Vigan , Ilocos Sur , Florentino was a poet of Ilustrado background who wrote in Ilocano and Spanish .
her poems were recognized in Europe in 1889 following her untimely death .
parallel to this , the United States of America established an English-based public education system .
both men and women were able to study in schools , colleges , universities such as the University of the Philippines .
women were gradually beginning to regain equal footing with men , as it was during precolonial times .
during this European-Hispanic to Anglo-American linguistic transition , among the women who became active in creating Philippine literature in English were Paz Marquez Benitez , Paz M.
Latorena , Estrella Alfon , Angela Manalang-Gloria , Genoveva Edroza-Matute , Loreto Paras-Sulit , Lilledeshan Bose , Cristina Pantoja-Hidalgo , and Lina Espina-Moore .
most of these literary pioneers also wrote simultaneously in the vernacular , although there were also those who became defiant and wrote exclusively in their mother tongue .
an example of which was Magdalena Jalandoni , a Hiligaynon-language writer who was able to produce volumes of manuscripts .
among Jalandoni ’ s 24 Hiligaynon novels , two were translated into English .
those who excelled in both English and their local lingua franca was Lina Espina Moore , who became known as a forefront promoter of Cebuano literature .
Moore &apos;s 1968 novel , Heart of the Lotus was the first Cebuano novel in the English language .
Filipino women authors also became active pariticipants in the development of Philippine media .
as discussed , during World War II , the Japanese were able to influence and encourage the Philippine literati in developing the vernacular literature , in parallel existence with the English language introduced by the Americans through public education .
the impact of this fellow-Asian intervention lingered through and survived after the Philippines achieved the status of a freely governing Republic .
exemplars are the Philippine-language works written by Lualhati Bautista and Liwayway Arceo .
there were also published manuscripts that confer personal familiarity with events that occurred during the four-year-long Japanese period such as those achieved by Estrella Alfon , Maria Luna Lopez , and Rosa Henson .
the 20-year authoritarian rule of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s brought forth literary themes of cultural revolution , social awakening and political consciousness , reinvigorated nationalism , opinionated movements and protests , disapproval of the patriarchal society , and mass migration .
women writers began writing about the situations of female domestic helpers and slum dwellers employing their skills in both the vernacular and English .
the purpose of writing also in the native language was to stimulate , educate and awaken consciousness of the citizenry .
many writers were either “ detained , tortured , ” or “ killed .
” Among the women who became writers of this societal , political and activist genre were Gilda Cordero-Fernando and Ninotchka Rosca .
anti-Marcos movements , the “ fiery texts ” of writers , the People Power movement or the 1986 Edsa Revolution dislodged the despot from the seat of power , and was replaced by an elected first woman president , Corazon C.
Filipino women have been receiving recognition and support from non-governmental organizations , libraries , and other publishers , but despite the efforts of these organizations and the writers themselves there are challenges that still confront Filipino women ’ s literary career .
these include literary commercialism that prevents women writers from becoming parallel with so-called &quot; esteemed authors &quot; , the struggle for additional acknowledgment of their status as writers , and obstacles related to economics .
one aspect of Filipino women writings includes the production of the so-called “ migratory literature , ” an account of how and why women had to leave their country in order to excel and express themselves through pen and print .
in the 1930s , Filipino women authors opted to travel after obtaining the liberty to do so , and for other reasons such as the lack of a grant system within the confines of a developing country and the “ resistance of a patriarchal society ” .
but the exodus of Filipino female writers during the 1970s differed in purpose from that of the 1930s , because they left the country to survive economically and escape government persecution .
one of the first voyager-writers was Paz Latorena .
the destinations of journeying migrant settlers were North America - primarily the United States – and Europe , Australia , Arab nations , Japan , Singapore and other Asian countries .
in general , this “ Great Migration ” of Filipinos created “ films , novels , short stories , poetry and comics ” in the Philippines that portrayed wayfarers as economic heroes and heroines of the country .
yet there were still some of those who chose to remain , instead of abandoning the Philippines , as in the case of Lilledeshan Bose ; and there were also home-comers who , after traveling and staying abroad , returned to stay permanently , such as Cristina Pantoja-Hidalgo .
other authors of “ migrant literature ” are Marianne Villanueva , Nadine Sarreal and Edessa Ramos .
in addition , the Filipino settlers who founded Filipino communities in the United States of America triggered the generation of Filipino-American literature such as the works of female novelist Jessica Hagedorn .
outside the country , there is the Philippine-Finnish Society in Helsinki , Finland .
samples of published Filipino women literature are Comfort Woman : slave of Destiny by Rosa Henson published by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism , and Tulikärpänen - filippiiniläisiä novelleja or Firefly : writings by Various Authors ( Firefly : Filipina Short Stories ) by Riitta Vartti sponsored by the Philippine-Finnish Society .
another non-governmental human rights organization publication is She Said No ! , an anthology of stories .
the Ateneo Library of Women ’ s Writings - a part of the Rizal Library at the Ateneo de Manila University and the first of its kind in Philippines - facilitates the collection , archiving , preservation , and promotion of Filipino women literature about and written by Filipino women .
the program includes the acquisition of related photographic material , and literary promotion are held through lectures , exhibitions , publications and book launchings .
ALIWW holds the annual Paz Marquez-Benitez Memorial Lectures , a series of lectures established to honor Paz Marquez-Benitez who is considered as the “ matriarch of Filipino writers in English ” .
this special program also assists in bringing to light Filipino women who excel in vernacular writings .

year 240 ( CCXL ) was a leap year starting on Wednesday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar .
at the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Sabinus and Venustus ( or , less frequently , year 993 Ab urbe condita ) .

historical markers are installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines ( NHCP ) in the Philippines and places abroad that signify important events , persons , structures , and institutions in Philippine national and local histories .
the plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings , monuments , or in special locations .
while many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed , not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties .
as of January 2012 , the total number of historical markers is 459 .
the earliest predecessor of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines ( NHCP ) was the Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee .
established in 1933 during the American colonial era , one of its tasks was to mark cultural and historical antiquities in Manila , which was later expanded to cover the rest of the Philippines .
the first markers were installed in 1934 , including ones for Church of San Agustin , Fort Santiago , Plaza McKinley , Roman Catholic Cathedral of Manila , San Sebastian Church , Concordia College , and Manila Railroad Company .
some of these markers were either lost or destroyed during World War II and new markers were installed as replacements for San Agustin Church and Manila Cathedral .
the standard shape of markers has changed throughout the years .
these lists of historical markers installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines ( NHCP ) are annotated lists of people , places , or events in the Philippines that have been commemorated by cast-iron plaques issued by the said commission .
there are markers installed by the NHCP outside the Philippines commemorating Philippine-related events , and there is a separate list on these markers .

Bhutan was founded and unified as a country by Ngawang Namgyal , 1st Zhabdrung Rinpoche in the mid – 17th century .
after his death in 1651 , Bhutan nominally followed his recommended &quot; dual system of government &quot; .
under the dual system , government control was split between a civil administrative leader , the Druk Desi ( འབྲུག ་ སྡེ ་ སྲིད ་ , aka Deb Raja ) ; &#91; nb 1 &#93; and a religious leader , the Je Khenpo ( རྗེ ་ མཁན ་ པོ ་ ) .
both the Druk Desi and Je Khenpo were under the nominal authority of the Zhabdrung Rinpoche , a reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal .
the king of Bhutan , formally known as the Druk Gyalpo ( &quot; Dragon King &quot; ) , also occupies the office of Druk Desi under the dual system of government .

some residents of Metro Manila also speak Visayan .
over 30 languages constitute the Visayan language family .
this is misleading or may lead to confusion as different languages may be called Bisaya by their respective speakers despite their languages being mutually unintelligible .
however , languages that are classified within the Visayan language family but spoken natively in places outside of the Visayas do not use the self-reference Bisaya or Binisaya .
to speakers of Masbateño , Romblomanon , Surigaonon and Butuanon , the term Visaya usually refers to either Cebuano or Hiligaynon .
since Tausugs are mostly Muslims , they view the term Bisaya as a religious term referring to Christian Filipinos ( mostly referring to either Cebuano and / or Hiligaynon as they are the neighboring languages ) .
David Zorc gives the following internal classification for the Visayan languages ( Zorc 1977 : 32 ) .
the South Visayan languages are considered to have diverged first , followed by Cebuan and then the rest of the three branches .
a total of 36 varieties are listed below .
individual languages are marked by italics .

Myrtis is the name given by archaeologists to an 11-year-old girl from ancient Athens , whose remains were discovered in 1994 – 95 in a mass grave during work to build the metro station at Kerameikos , Greece .
the name was chosen from common ancient Greek names .
the analysis showed that Myrtis and two other bodies in the mass grave had died of typhoid fever during the Plague of Athens in 430 BCE .
the United Nations Regional Information Centre made Myrtis a friend of the Millennium Development Goals and used her in the UN campaign &quot; We Can End Poverty &quot; .
human skeletal evidence from Classical Greece is scarce , as most burials at that time were preceded by cremation .
before Myrtis , no attempt to reconstruct an Ancient Greek layperson &apos;s face has been recorded .
Myrtis &apos; skull was in an unusually good condition and Greek orthodontics professor Manolis Papagrigorakis requested help from Swedish specialists to recreate her facial features .
a special scanner was employed for the non-invasive acquisition of high-resolution anatomic data of Myrtis &apos; skull .
the volume of the skull was determined at 446 cm3 .
following scanning , an exact replica of her skull was created , which became the basis for subsequent forensic facial reconstruction .
the reconstruction process followed the so-called &quot; Manchester method &quot; : the facial tissues were laid from the skull surface outward by using depth marker pegs to determine thickness .
the shape , size and position of the eyes , ears , nose and mouth were determined through the features of the underlying skeletal tissues .
20 different muscles were sculpted .
the thickness of the facial tissues were evaluated according to average values taken from corresponding reference tables for age , gender and race .
the mouth width and the lip thickness were estimated by the pattern and the skeletal craniofacial attributes of the associated area .
Myrtis &apos; reconstructed face was given brown eyes and brown hair , but the true colors of these can only be determined by DNA analysis .
the hairstyle she was given follows the fashion of the time .
a class II skeletal and dental malocclusion was observed in Myrtis &apos; remains .
other reported dental issues are the ectopic labial eruption of the maxillary canines mesially to their retained deciduous predecessors , the ectopic distally directed eruption of a lower first premolar and a unilaterally missing lower third molar .

Nebbiuno borders the following municipalities : Armeno , Lesa , Massino Visconti , Meina , and Pisano .
even today , egyptologists are disputing the identity and chronological position of Nebka .
the clay seal as a proof was therefore not convincing enough .
they also point out , that the mother of king Djoser , queen Nimaethap , was entitled as a “ Mother of a king ” , and that this title was used in a singular form .
therefore , she should have had only one son , who ascended the throne - no place for a “ Sanakht ” or “ Nebka ” .
for this reason many scholars believe that the name “ Nebka ” was simply misplaced by mistake .

the negligee or négligée , from the French : négligé , literally meaning &quot; neglected &quot; , known in French as déshabillé , is a form of see-through clothing for women consisting of a sheer usually long dressing gown .
it is a form of nightgown intended for wear at night and in the bedroom .
it was introduced in France in the 18th century , where it mimicked the heavy head-to-toe style of women &apos;s day dresses of the time .
by the 1920s , the negligee began to mimic women &apos;s satin single-layer evening dress of the period .
the term &quot; negligee &quot; was used on a Royal Doulton run of ceramic figurines in 1927 , showing women wearing what appears to be a one-piece knee-length silk or rayon slip , trimmed with lace .
although the evening-dresses style of nightwear made moves towards the modern negligee style — translucent bodices , lace trimming , bows , exemplified in 1941 by a photo of Rita Hayworth in Life — it was only after World War II that nightwear changed from being primarily utilitarian to being primarily sensual or even erotic ; the negligee emerged strongly as a form of lingerie .
modern negligees are often much looser and made of sheer and diaphanous fabrics and trimmed with lace or other fine material , and bows .
multiple layers of fabric are often used .
the modern negligee thus perhaps owes more to women &apos;s fine bedjackets or bed-capes , and up-market slips than to the nightgown .
it spread to a mass market , benefitting from the introduction of cheap synthetic fabrics such as nylon and its finer successors .

in the UK in 2004 , negligees accounted for only four percent of women &apos;s nightwear sales , women &apos;s pyjamas having dominated since the mid-1980s .
however , UK negligee sales are said to have been the fastest increasing sector of the market since 1998 .

in supersymmetry , the neutralino is a hypothetical particle .
there are four neutralinos that are fermions and are electrically neutral , the lightest of which is typically stable .
they are typically labeled N͂0 1 ( the lightest ) , N͂0 2 , N͂0 3 and N͂0 4 ( the heaviest ) although sometimes χ ~ 1 0 , … , χ ~ 4 0 { \ displaystyle { \ tilde { \ chi } } _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } , \ ldots , { \ tilde { \ chi } } _ { 4 } ^ { 0 } } is also used when χ ~ i ± { \ displaystyle { \ tilde { \ chi } } _ { i } ^ { \ pm } } is used to refer to charginos .

Odiongan is a first-class , partially urban municipality in the province of Romblon , Philippines .
it is a major port , commercial center and the largest municipality of Romblon in terms of population and income .
legend has it , that the inhabitants found an &quot; odiong &quot; ( local term for &quot; arrow &quot; ) struck to a tree ; thus , the place was called Inodiongan , meaning &quot; struck by an arrow &quot; , which later metamorphosed to Odiongan .
historically , Odiongan , as of most of Tablas Island , was first settled by migrant Negrito and Mangyan tribes from the Panay Island to south and Mindoro Island respectively .
this was followed shortly by Onhan-speaking settlers from Panay .
in 1855 , the settlement was officially designated by the Spanish colonial authorities as a &quot; pueblo &quot; or town .
when the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896 , the town joined the cause of the revolutionaries led by Tomas Fiedacan .
during the American colonial period in the Philippines , Odiongan faced a number of catastrophes : a cholera epidemic in 1902 killed much of the town &apos;s population , a strong typhoon lashed the town in 1908 , and famine struck the town in 1914 .
however , the perseverance and determination of the townsfolk led to the town &apos;s continuous existence .
in 1940 , the town became the seat of the special municipality of Tablas , created by virtue of Commonwealth Act No .
581 ( authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin ) , which covered the entire island .
it remained so throughout the Japanese occupation of the Philippines from 1941-1945 .
during that time , Odiongan was chosen as the headquarters of the resistance movement in the province , under the leadership of Lt.
Enrique Jurado .
on 4 September 1943 , a Japanese gunboat shelled the town to force the guerrillas out of hiding .
this was followed the following month by a landing of Japanese forces from Panay , which massacred people in the various towns of Tablas , Romblon , and Sibuyan , including Odiongan .
on 1 October 1946 , the special municipality of Tablas was abolished by Republic Act No .
the following year , Odiongan was restored to its original jurisdiction as municipality in the province of Romblon .
Odiongan is located in the mid-western part of Tablas Island .
it is bounded by San Andres and San Agustin to the north , by Santa Maria to the east , by Looc and Alcantara to the south , and by Ferrol and Tablas Strait to the west .
Odiongan has a total land area of 18,567 hectares ( 45,880 acres ) .
much of the town lies in the low-lying plains along the coast , with rolling hills and mountainous forest area at the interior .

the Omega baryons are a family of subatomic hadron ( a baryon ) particles that are represented by the symbol Ω and are either neutral or have a + 2 , + 1 or − 1 elementary charge .
the first Omega baryon discovered was the Ω − , made of three strange quarks , in 1964 .
besides the Ω − , a charmed Omega particle ( Ω0 c ) was discovered , in which a strange quark is replaced by a charm quark .
the Ω − decays only via the weak interaction and has therefore a relatively long lifetime .
spin ( J ) and parity ( P ) values for unobserved baryons are predicted by the quark model .
† Particle ( or quantity , i .
the Ω − b particle is a &quot; doubly strange &quot; baryon containing two strange quarks and a bottom quark .
a discovery of this particle was first claimed in September 2008 by physicists working on the DØ experiment at the Tevatron facility of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory .
however , the reported mass of 7003616500000000000 ♠ 6165 ± 16 MeV / c2 was significantly higher than expected in the quark model .
the apparent discrepancy from the Standard Model has since been dubbed the &quot; Ω b puzzle &quot; .
in May 2009 , the CDF collaboration made public their results on the search for the Ω − b based on analysis of a data sample roughly four times the size of the one used by the DØ experiment .
CDF measured the mass to be 7003605440000000000 ♠ 6054 .
8 MeV / c2 , which was in excellent agreement with the Standard Model prediction .
no signal has been observed at the DØ reported value .
the two results differ by 7002111000000000000 ♠ 111 ± 18 MeV / c2 , which is equivalent to 6 .
2 standard deviations and are therefore inconsistent .
excellent agreement between the CDF measured mass and theoretical expectations is a strong indication that the particle discovered by CDF is indeed the Ω − b .

in June 2015 , Forbes listed their earnings at $ 130 million for the previous twelve months , and ranked them the fourth highest earning celebrities in the world .
after the release of Four , One Direction became the first band in the US Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one .
their third album , Midnight Memories , was the biggest-selling album worldwide of 2013 despite being released in late November .
the band &apos;s Where We Are Tour in support of Midnight Memories and Four , was the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014 , and the highest-grossing tour ever by a vocal group , generating $ 282 million .
in 2014 , Billboard named One Direction Artist of the Year .
the band is temporarily on a hiatus that began in January 2016 , which is expected to last around 18 months .
in 2010 , Niall Horan , Zayn Malik , Liam Payne , Harry Styles , and Louis Tomlinson auditioned as solo candidates for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor .
they failed to progress to the &quot; Boys &quot; category at &quot; judges &apos; houses &quot; but were put together to form a five-piece boy band at Wembley Arena , in London , England , in July 2010 , during the &quot; bootcamp &quot; stage of the competition , thus qualifying for the &quot; Groups &quot; category .
for their qualifying song at &quot; judges &apos; houses &quot; , and their first song as a group , One Direction sang an acoustic version of &quot; Torn &quot; .
Cowell later commented that their performance convinced him that they &quot; were confident , fun , like a gang of friends , and kind of fearless as well .
&quot; within the first four weeks of the live shows , they were his last act in the competition .
the group quickly gained popularity in the UK .
one Direction achieved third place in the competition and immediately after the final , their song &quot; Forever Young &quot; , which would have been released if they had won The X Factor , was leaked onto the internet .
shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported £ 2 million Syco Records record contract .
recording for their debut album began in January 2011 , as they flew to Los Angeles to work with RedOne , a record producer .
a book licensed by One Direction , One Direction : forever Young ( Our Official X Factor Story ) , was published by HarperCollins in February 2011 , subsequently topping The Sunday Times Best Seller list .
the same month , the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour .
during the tour , the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK .
after the tour concluded in April 2011 , the group continued working on their debut album .
recording took place in Stockholm , London and Los Angeles , as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk , Savan Kotecha , Steve Mac , and Rami Yacoub , among others .
released in September 2011 , One Direction &apos;s debut single , &quot; What Makes You Beautiful &quot; , reached number one on the UK Singles Chart , after becoming the most pre-ordered Sony Music Entertainment single in history .

critically commended for its appeal to the teenage audience , One Direction &apos;s first studio album , Up All Night , was released globally in early 2012 .
it became the UK &apos;s fastest-selling debut album of 2011 , and topped the charts in sixteen countries .
up All Night also became the first album by a boy band to sell 500,000 digital copies in the US and , by August 2012 , had sold over 3 million copies worldwide .
in April 2012 , an American band that went by the same name filed a trademark infringement lawsuit .
according to the lawsuit , the US band had been using the name since 2009 , recorded two albums and filed an application to register the trademark name in the US in February 2011 .
the US band said they were entitled to three times the profits made by the UK band , as well as compensatory damages in excess of US $ 1million .
the lawsuit claimed that Syco and Sony Music &quot; chose to ignore the plaintiff &apos;s rights and wilfully infringed them &quot; after they realised in early 2011 that the two bands shared the same name .
Syco Records subsequently counter-sued , suggesting the US group was trying to make money from One Direction &apos;s success and that the boy band was the first to use the name in US interstate commerce .
the BBC reported in September 2012 that the UK group won the legal dispute over the right to keep using their band name ; the US band changed its name to Uncharted Shores .
the change of name was announced in a joint statement that also noted both groups were happy with the outcome .
in December 2011 , One Direction embarked on their first headlining UK concert tour , the Up All Night Tour .

in June 2012 , Nick Gatfield , the chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Music Entertainment UK , stated how he expects One Direction to represent a $ 100 million business empire over 2013 .
Gatfield was quoted as saying , &quot; What you might not know about One Direction is that they already represent a $ 50 million business and that &apos;s a figure we expect to double next year &quot; .
in August 2012 , the group &apos;s record sales exceeded 8 million singles , 3 million albums , and 1 million DVDs , and they performed &quot; What Makes You Beautiful &quot; at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London , which represented the handover to Rio de Janeiro as the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics .

one Direction &apos;s debut studio album , Up All Night ( 2011 ) , is predominantly a pop music record , containing elements of teen pop , dance-pop , pop rock , with electropop and rock influences .
digital Spy &apos;s Robert Copsey described the album as a &quot; collection of PG pop rock with killer choruses &quot; , while The New York Times considered it &quot; full of easy rock-inflected pop , blithe and sometimes clever .
&quot; Jason Lipshutz of Billboard acknowledged that the album demonstrates an originality in sound that was &quot; necessary for the revitalization of the boy band movement &quot; .
the songs &quot; One Thing &quot; and &quot; What Makes You Beautiful &quot; were particularly noted for the genres of power pop and pop rock , for their &quot; powerhouse &quot; guitar riffs and &quot; forceful &quot; choruses .
&quot; Jon Caramanica , writing in The New York Times , considered the album &quot; far more mechanical &quot; than their debut album , although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar .
the album &apos;s lyricism speaks of falling in love , unrequited love , the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique , commitment , jealousy and longing for past significant others .
melody Lau of the National Post wrote , &quot; It &apos;s easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere in the midst of all the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and , to a certain extent , entertain .
&quot; Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred : &quot; what I didn &apos;t really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert .
&quot; Chris Richards , writing in The Washington Post , dissented from the approval : &quot; as the five traded couplets , it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake , Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack .
no one voice stood out .
&quot; Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction &apos;s &quot; surprisingly accomplished effort &quot; of Kings of Leon &apos;s &quot; Use Somebody &quot; proved that One Direction are &quot; more than capable &quot; of evolving their sound .
their third album Midnight Memories ( 2013 ) is a pop rock record , a slight departure from the band &apos;s original teen pop sound .
Liam Payne called Midnight Memories a &quot; slightly rockier and edgier &quot; album than their previous material .
the album is heavily influenced by 80 &apos;s rock and folk music and briefly integrates elements of dubstep , notably in &quot; Little White Lies &quot; .
the album &apos;s lyrical themes primarily revolve around love , heartbreak and sexual intercourse .
their fourth album Four ( 2014 ) was released on 17 November 2014 .
Payne once again claimed that the album would be &quot; edgier &quot; and that the group had written most of the songs for it ; Horan came up with the name of the album , commemorating the fact that it is One Direction &apos;s fourth record to date and that it has been four years since the band &apos;s formation .
signifying a further maturation of their pop sound , the album &apos;s first single , Steal My Girl , was dubbed by Billboard as &quot; no What Makes You Beautiful , but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction &quot; , and that the band was &quot; not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days &quot; .
Rolling Stone described the record as &quot; saturated with retro vibes &quot; ; its songs &quot; split the difference between big , splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that &apos;s not so far from what Haim &apos;s hit Days Are Gone did last year .
in 2011 , the band performed on the BBC &apos;s Children in Need 2011 charity telethon , helping raise over 26 million pounds .
in 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single &quot; Live While We &apos;re Young &quot; .
a prominent annual event in British culture , the group said it was &quot; incredible &quot; to be involved in Children in Need as it was something that they had &quot; always watched as children &quot; .
in February 2013 , One Direction released &quot; One Way or Another ( Teenage Kicks ) &quot; ( a medley of &quot; One Way or Another &quot; and &quot; Teenage Kicks &quot; ) as the 2013 single for the UK &apos;s other major charity telethon Comic Relief .
for ITV &apos;s Santa charity Christmas campaign , they filmed a set of pleas to their fans and the general public , asking them to donate £ 2 .
due to overwhelming demand to participate in the fundraising , the ticket website for the event broke down .
in 2013 , band members Liam Payne and Harry Styles partnered with Trekstock , a leading cancer charity to help raise money for cancer research .
as ambassadors of the charity , the duo collaborated to offer the chance for one fan and a friend to win an evening out with them in return for a donation to the charity as part of an exclusive &quot; # HangwithLiam &amp; Harry &quot; global campaign .
they had originally set a goal of raising $ 500,000 and ended up raising $ 784,984 .
Trekstock later added that this amount would allow them to &quot; complete funding of their Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma trial , in the hope of offering a much brighter future to thousands of children and young people affected by this form of disease .
&quot; one Direction were named the most charitable in 2013 behind Taylor Swift by social change organisation DoSomething .
in 2014 , One Direction donated £ 600,000 for the Stand up to Cancer campaign by giving portions of their ticket sales revenues from their Where We Are Tour .
Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph , in an article on One Direction &apos;s success in North America , notes that Americans had left a gap in the market and it took the prominence of Justin Bieber to demonstrate that there still was a market for &quot; clean cut , wholesome , whiter-than-white , middle class parent friendly pop : cute boys advocating puppy love .
and what could be better than one cute boy , if not five ? &quot; one Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the interest in boy bands , and as forming part of a new &quot; British Invasion &quot; in the United States .
Bill Werde , a representative of Billboard magazine , commented , &quot; There &apos;s a lot of possibility here , there &apos;s a lot of upside , that level of talent with those kinds of looks , it &apos;s really a perfect storm for a massive , massive successful phenomenon .
Sonny Takhar , the chief executive officer of Syco Records , attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media .
&quot; sometimes you feel the song &apos;s the star , but it &apos;s not like that here – it &apos;s the act , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s a real moment .
social media has become the new radio , it &apos;s never broken an act globally like this before .
&quot; will Bloomfield , the group &apos;s manager , added , &quot; These guys live online , and so do their fans .
one Direction &apos;s Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013 , with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day .
Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band , &quot; People think that a boy band is air-grabs and &#91; being &#93; dressed in all one colour .
we &apos;re boys in a band .
we &apos;re trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band .
we &apos;re trying to do different kinds of music and we &apos;re just trying to be ourselves , not squeaky clean .

in April 1945 , the Japanese battleship Yamato ( the heaviest battleship in the world ) , along with nine other Japanese warships , embarked from Japan on a deliberate suicide attack upon Allied forces engaged in the Battle of Okinawa .
most of the remaining Japanese warships in the Combined Fleet were stationed at ports in Japan , with most of the large ships at Kure , Hiroshima .
in preparation for executing the plan , the assigned ships left Kure for Tokuyama , Yamaguchi , off Mitajiri , Japan , on 29 March .
as he was told that the aim of this operation was &quot; the tradition and the glory of Navy , &quot; he shouted : .
this war is of our nation and why should the honor of our &quot; surface fleet &quot; be more respected ? who cares about their glory ? damn fools ! .
however , approximately 80 crew members who were new , sick , or infirm , were ordered off the ships .
at midnight , the ships were fueled .
at 16 : 00 on 6 April , Yamato , with Admiral Ito on board , the light cruiser Yahagi and eight destroyers departed Tokuyama to begin the mission .
one of the Japanese destroyers — Asashimo — developed engine trouble and turned back .
reconnaissance aircraft began to shadow the main force of ships .
at 10 : 00 , the Japanese force turned west to make it look like they were withdrawing , but at 11 : 30 , after being detected by two American PBM Mariner flying boats ( the Yamato fired a salvo with her 460 mm ( 18 .
1 in ) bow guns using special &quot; beehive shells &quot; ( 三式焼霰弾 ( san-shiki shōsan dan ? ) but could not prevent the two planes from shadowing the Japanese force ) , they turned back towards Okinawa .
upon receiving contact reports early on 7 April , U.
5th Fleet commander Admiral Raymond Spruance ordered Task Force 54 , which consisted mostly of modernized Standard battleships under the command of Admiral Morton Deyo ( which were engaged in shore bombardment ) , to intercept and destroy the Japanese sortie .
Deyo moved to execute his orders , but Vice Admiral Marc A.
Mitscher , who commanded Task Force 58 ( TF 58 ) , preempted Spruance and Deyo by launching a massive air strike from his carriers , without informing Spruance until after the launches were completed .
around 10 : 00 on 7 April , Task Groups 58 .
1 and 58 .
3 ( TG 58 .
1 and 58 .
3 ) began launching almost 400 aircraft in several waves from eight carriers ( TG 58 .
1 : Hornet , Bennington , Belleau Wood , San Jacinto ; TG 58 .
3 Essex , Bunker Hill , Hancock and Bataan ) that were located just east of Okinawa .
the aircraft consisted of F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair fighters , SB2C Helldiver dive bombers , and TBF Avenger torpedo bombers .
after being informed of Mitscher &apos;s launches , Spruance agreed that the airstrikes could go ahead as planned .
as a contingency , Spruance ordered Admiral Deyo to assemble a force of six battleships ( Massachusetts , Indiana , New Jersey , South Dakota , Wisconsin , and Missouri ) , together with seven cruisers ( including the large cruisers Alaska and Guam ) and 21 destroyers , and to prepare for a surface engagement with Yamato should the airstrikes prove unsuccessful .
around 12 : 00 , the first American aircraft arrived over Yamato ; these were F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair fighters , which were under orders to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear to defend the ships below .
none did .
the first wave of U.
the U.
at 12 : 46 , a torpedo hit Yahagi directly in her engine room , killing the entire engineering room crew and bringing her to a complete stop .
Yahagi was hit by at least six more torpedoes and 12 bombs by succeeding waves of air attacks .
the Japanese destroyer Isokaze attempted to come to Yahagi &apos;s aid but was attacked and heavily damaged , and sank sometime later .
Yahagi capsized and sank at 14 : 05 .
during the first attack wave , despite intensive evasive maneuvers that caused most of the bombs and torpedoes aimed at her to miss , Yamato was hit by two armor-piercing bombs and one torpedo .
her speed was not affected , but one of the bombs started a fire aft of the superstructure that was not extinguished .
Hamakaze sank later .
between 13 : 20 and 14 : 15 , the second and third waves of U.
aircraft attacked , heavily concentrating on Yamato .
during this time , Yamato was hit by at least eight torpedoes and up to 15 bombs .
the loss of the starboard engines — plus the weight of the water — caused Yamato to slow to about 10 kn ( 12 mph ; 19 km / h ) .
with Yamato proceeding more slowly and therefore easier to target , U.
Yamato communicated this message to the other surviving ships by signal flag because her radios had been destroyed .
at 14 : 05 , Yamato was stopped dead in the water and began to capsize .
Admiral Ito and Captain Aruga refused to abandon her with the rest of the survivors .
at 14 : 20 , Yamato capsized completely and began to sink ( 30 ° 22 ′ N 128 ° 04 ′ E ﻿ / ﻿ 30 .
367 ° N 128 .

at 14 : 23 , she suddenly blew up with an explosion so large that it was reportedly heard and seen 200 km ( 110 nmi ; 120 mi ) away in Kagoshima and sent up a mushroom-shaped cloud almost 20,000 ft ( 6,100 m ) into the air .
Japanese survivor Yoshida Mitsuru said that her large explosion downed several U.
planes observing her end .
the explosion is believed to have occurred when the fires ignited by bomb hits reached the main magazines .
attempting to make it back to port , Japanese destroyer Asashimo was bombed and sunk with all hands by U.
the Japanese destroyer Kasumi was also crippled by U.
carrier aircraft attack during the battle and had to be scuttled by other , relatively undamaged Japanese destroyers .
Suzutsuki — despite her bow being blown off — was able to make it to Sasebo , Japan , by steaming in reverse the entire way .
the remaining three less-damaged Japanese destroyers ( Fuyutsuki , Yukikaze , and Hatsushimo ) were able to rescue 280 survivors from Yamato ( sources differ on the size of Yamato &apos;s crew , giving it as between 2,750 and 3,300 men ) , plus 555 survivors from Yahagi ( out of a crew of 1,000 ) and just over 800 survivors from Isokaze , Hamakaze , and Kasumi .
between 3,700 and 4,250 Japanese naval personnel perished in the battle .
the ships took the survivors to Sasebo .
around 115 aircraft — many of them kamikaze — attacked the U.
ships throughout the day of 7 April .
kamikaze aircraft hit the aircraft carrier Hancock , battleship Maryland , and destroyer Bennett , causing moderate damage to Hancock and Maryland and heavy damage to Bennett .
about 100 of the Japanese aircraft were lost in the attack .
Suzutsuki was never repaired .
air-dropped mine at Moji , Japan , on 20 August 1945 , and was not subsequently repaired .
Yukikaze survived the war almost undamaged .
air-dropped mine on 30 July 1945 , near Maizuru , Japan , and was the 129th , and last , Japanese destroyer sunk in the war .
Maryland was kept out of the war following the kamikaze attacks .
Okinawa was declared secure by Allied forces on 21 June 1945 , after an intense and costly battle .
Japan surrendered in August 1945 , after being bombed twice with atomic weapons .
the apparent willingness of Japan to sacrifice so many of its people using suicidal tactics such as Operation Ten-Go and in the Battle of Okinawa reportedly was a factor in the American decision to employ atomic weapons against Japan .
the story of Operation Ten-Go is revered to some degree in modern Japan as evidenced by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave , selfless , but futile , symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland .
thus , the end of battleship Yamato could serve as a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire .

&quot; Over-the-edge &quot; is a common position for deep-throating .
the April 2005 attacks were three related incidents that took place in the city of Cairo , Egypt , on 7 April and 30 April 2005 .
on Thursday , 7 April 2005 , a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device on Sharia al-Moski in Islamic Cairo , near the al-Hussein Mosque and Khan el-Khalili , a major souq popular with tourists and Egyptians alike .
three foreign tourists ( two French and one American ) were killed , and 11 Egyptians and seven other overseas visitors were injured .
Egyptian police identified the bomber as Muhammad Sobhi Ali Jidan , originally from Qalyubia Governorate in northern Egypt , but then living in the north Cairo district of Shobra .
the first of a number of attacks on Saturday , 30 April took place at 15h15 Egypt summer time ( 12h15 UTC ) in a city bus station located in a 300-metre-wide concourse between the Ramses Hilton Hotel and the Egyptian Museum near Cairo &apos;s main traffic intersection .
Ehab Yousri Yassin , an Egyptian man suspected of involvement in the 7 April attack , was being pursued along the Sixth of October Bridge , a flyover leading into centre of Cairo from the River Nile island of Gezira .
he apparently leapt from the bridge down into the bus station below , with a nail bomb that he was carrying detonating as he fell .
the bomber was killed and seven passersby were injured : three Egyptians and four foreign tourists ( an Israeli couple , an Italian woman , and a Swedish ) .
approximately two hours later the same day , two veiled females armed with guns opened fire on a tourist bus in the neighbourhood known as Islamic Cairo , not far from the Citadel .
after firing on the coach , one of the women shot the other dead before turning her gun on herself .
three bystanders were reportedly injured .
police sources later revealed that the women were Negat Yassin , Ehab Yousri Yassin &apos;s sister , and Iman Ibrahim Khamis , his wife ( described as his fiancée in some early reports ) .
this was the first attack in modern Egyptian history to be carried out by women ; police believe it arose from a spur of the moment decision taken by the women upon learning of the Sixth of October Bridge incident .
two groups claimed responsibility in the early evening hours , local time : the Mujahedeen of Egypt and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades .
in its statement , the latter group said the attacks were in retaliation for the government &apos;s clampdown on dissidents in the wake of the Sinai Peninsula bombings of October 2004 .
in the early hours of Sunday , 1 May , security forces arrested some 225 individuals for questioning , mostly from the dead three &apos;s home villages and from the area where they lived in Shubra .

the comparative study of economic systems was of significant practical and political significance during the Cold War , when the relative merits of capitalist and communist systems of economic and political organization were a central topic of political concern .
one of the most important early contributions was the calculation debate regarding the assertion of Ludwig von Mises that a system of central planning could never work because the information generated by a price system would never be available to planners .
one response was the advocacy / avocado and partial implementation of systems of market socialism .
with the fall of Communism , attention shifted to problems of transition economies .
with a handful of exceptions , all currently existing systems are capitalist in orientation , though the substantial economic role of the state supports the alternative view that the mixed economy has emerged as the dominant form of economic organisations .

the Philippine Declaration of Independence ( Filipino : Pagpapahayag ng Kasarinlan ng Pilipinas ) was proclaimed on June 12 , 1898 in Cavite II el Viejo ( present-day Kawit , Cavite ) , Philippines .
in 1896 , the Philippine Revolution began .
in December 1897 , the Spanish government and the revolutionaries signed a truce , the Pact of Biak-na-Bato , requiring that the Spanish pay the revolutionaries 800,000 pesos and that Aguinaldo and other leaders go into exile in Hong Kong .
in April 1898 , at the outbreak of the Spanish – American War , Commodore George Dewey aboard the U.
Olympia sailed from Hong Kong to Manila Bay leading the Asiatic Squadron of the U.
on May 1 , 1898 , the United States defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Manila Bay .
independence was proclaimed on June 12 , 1898 between four and five in the afternoon in Cavite at the ancestral home of General Emilio Aguinaldo some 30 kilometers South of Manila .
the event saw the unfurling of the National Flag of the Philippines , made in Hong Kong by Marcela Agoncillo , Lorenza Agoncillo , and Delfina Herboza , and the performance of the Marcha Filipina Magdalo , as the national anthem , now known as Lupang Hinirang , which was composed by Julián Felipe and played by the San Francisco de Malabon marching band .
the Act of the Declaration of Independence was prepared , written , and read by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista in Spanish .
the Declaration was signed by 98 people , among them an American army officer who witnessed the proclamation .
the final paragraph states that there was a &quot; stranger &quot; ( stranger in English translation — extranjero in the original Spanish , meaning foreigner ) who attended the proceedings , Mr.
Johnson , described as &quot; a citizen of the U.
a , a Colonel of Artillery &quot; .
the proclamation of Philippine independence was , however , promulgated on 1 August , when many towns had already been organized under the rules laid down by the Dictatorial Government of General Aguinaldo .
later at Malolos , Bulacan , the Malolos Congress modified the declaration upon the insistence of Apolinario Mabini who objected to that the original proclamation essentially placed the Philippines under the protection of the United States .
later in 1898 , Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in the 1898 Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish – American War .
pockets of resistance continued for several years .
following World War II , the US granted independence to the Philippines on 4 July 1946 via the Treaty of Manila .
July 4 was observed in the Philippines as Independence Day until August 4 , 1964 when , upon the advice of historians and the urging of nationalists , President Diosdado Macapagal signed into law Republic Act No .
4166 designating June 12 as the country &apos;s Independence Day .
June 12 had previously been observed as Flag Day and many government buildings are urged to display the Philippine Flag in their offices .
the Declaration is currently housed in the National Library of the Philippines .
it is not on public display but can be viewed with permission like any other document held by the National Library .
during the Philippine – American War , the American government captured and sent to the United States about 400,000 historical documents .
sometime in the 1980s or 1990s the Declaration was stolen from the National Library .
as part of a larger investigation into the widespread theft of historical documents and a subsequent public appeal for the return of stolen documents , the Declaration was returned to the National Library in 1994 by University of the Philippines professor Milagros Guerrero .
the Act of Proclamation of the Independence of the Filipino People ( Spanish : Acta de la proclamación de independencia del pueblo Filipino ; Filipino : Paggawa ng Proklamasyon ng Kasarinlan ng sambayanang Pilipino ) is part of a long line of declarations of independence including the United States Declaration of Independence .
it includes a list of grievances against the Spanish government stretching back to Ferdinand Magellan &apos;s arrival in 1521 and &quot; confer ( s ) upon our famous Dictator Don Emilio Aguinaldo all the powers necessary to enable him to discharge the duties of Government , including the prerogatives of granting pardon and amnesty .

the 2007 Glorietta explosion occurred in the Glorietta 2 section of the Glorietta shopping complex at Ayala Center in Makati , Metropolitan Manila , in the Philippines , on October 19 , 2007 , at around 1 : 25 PM PST .
initial reports indicated that the explosion originated from an LPG tank explosion in a restaurant in the mall .
however , authorities were unable to confirm the true nature or source of the explosion .
the blast killed eleven people and injured more than a hundred .
many of the victims were admitted at the Makati Medical Center and Ospital ng Makati .
the explosion initially killed eleven people through shrapnel wounds , and at least 126 others were injured .
the explosion was first reported to be due to an accidentally ignited LPG tank from Luk Yuen Noodle House .
however , due to the extensive damage caused by the explosion , the Philippine National Police ruled this out and considered the cause to be a bomb .
whilst there are indications that it was an accident , the possibility of a terrorist attack cannot be discounted , &quot; the FCO said in the advisory .
the National Disaster Coordinating Council ( as of 5 p .
Friday ) , identified 5 of the 11 fatalities as Lester Peregrina , Jose Alan de Jesus , Liza Enriquez and Janine Marcos and Maureen De Leon .
the latters body was recovered by Philippine National Red Cross rescue teams led by Richard Gordon .
meanwhile , the United States and the United Kingdom embassies expressed sympathy for the victims of the explosion , promising assistance to the PNP and government in the investigation .
officials also reported that 10 people were reported missing .
finally , at November 22 , 2007 the Philippine National Police had concluded that the explosion is caused by gas , and not a bomb .
however they still did not know how it happened .
the policemen are now working on the negligence angle .
; for violation of the Fire Code : engineer Ricardo Cruz , operations manager of Metalline Enterprises and its foreman , Miguel Velasco ; gross neglect of duty causing undue injury : Makati City Fire Station Senior Fire Officer 4 Anthony Grey , SFO2 Leonilo Balais , Senior Inspector Reynaldo Enoc , and Chief Inspector Jose Embang Jr .
; Makati City Fire Station chief - &quot; for simple neglect of duty-for failure to review and validate before issuing fire safety inspection certificate .
&quot; Ticman stated that per final report signed by DILG Secretary Ronaldo Puno - &quot; no bomb components were found at the basement of Glorietta 2 mall ; the absence of any crater , bomb / explosive residue , or improvised explosive device in the &quot; seat of explosion ; no soot or blackening on the concave ceiling .
the Australian Federal Police and Powerpoint copy of US ambassador Kristie Kenney &apos;s statement confirming the US experts &apos; findings similar to the police &apos;s investigation results supported the MAITF &apos;s findings .
on January 16 , 2008 , Kit Collier , an International Crisis Group consultant / international terror and insurgency expert , told foreign media members at the Annual Prospects Forum , Mandarin Hotel , Makati City , that he doubted the delayed final report of the Philippine National Police &apos;s findings that Glorietta 2 blast was due to a gas explosion .

the day after the blast , normal operations continued in the Glorietta Malls after engineers inspecting the remaining parts of the mall found these structurally sound .
Glorietta 2 remained closed , and some of the stores in the rest of the mall , mostly fast-food chains , remained closed .
on October 23 , 2007 , it was revealed on national television that closed-circuit TV cameras in the mall recorded actual scenes of the explosion .
the United States and the United Kingdom , through their respective embassies expressed sympathy for the victims of the explosion , promising assistance to the Philippine government and Philippine National Police in the investigation .
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo stated that there would be a full investigation of the explosion .
she also said that the Philippine police and military were on their highest alert status , and that an additional 2,000 security officers were being deployed in public areas .

decantation is a process for the separation of mixtures , by removing a layer of liquid , generally one from which a precipitate has settled .
the purpose may be either to produce a clean decant , or to remove undesired liquid from the precipitate ( or other layers ) .
if the aim is to produce a clean solution , a small amount of solution must generally be left in the container , and care must be taken to prevent any precipitate from flowing with the solution out of the container .
a mixture of an insoluble solid in liquid is allowed to stand .
the solid is insoluble and settles at the bottom if kept undisturbed for some time .
this process is called sedimentation .

today , we know that the &quot; transforming principle &quot; Griffith observed was the DNA of the III-s strain bacteria .
while the bacteria had been killed , the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria .
the III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the protective polysaccharide capsule .
equipped with this gene , the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host &apos;s immune system and could kill the host .
the exact nature of the transforming principle ( DNA ) was verified in the experiments done by Avery , McLeod and McCarty and by Hershey and Chase .
the test was said to be successful .

failure analysis is the process of collecting and analyzing data to determine the cause of a failure , often with the goal of determining corrective actions or liability .
it is an important discipline in many branches of manufacturing industry , such as the electronics industry , where it is a vital tool used in the development of new products and for the improvement of existing products .
the failure analysis process relies on collecting failed components for subsequent examination of the cause or causes of failure using a wide array of methods , especially microscopy and spectroscopy .
nondestructive testing ( NDT ) methods ( such as industrial computed tomography scanning ) are valuable because the failed products are unaffected by analysis , so inspection sometimes starts using these methods .
forensic inquiry into the failed process or product is the starting point of failure analysis .

Alpha – beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree .
it is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games ( Tic-tac-toe , Chess , Go , etc .
it stops completely evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move .
such moves need not be evaluated further .
Arthur Samuel had an early version and Richards , Hart , Levine and / or Edwards invented alpha – beta independently in the United States .
McCarthy proposed similar ideas during the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 and suggested it to a group of his students including Alan Kotok at MIT in 1961 .
Alexander Brudno independently conceived the alpha – beta algorithm , publishing his results in 1963 .
Donald Knuth and Ronald W.
Moore refined the algorithm in 1975 and Judea Pearl proved its optimality in 1982 .
the benefit of alpha – beta pruning lies in the fact that branches of the search tree can be eliminated .
this way , the search time can be limited to the &apos; more promising &apos; subtree , and a deeper search can be performed in the same time .
like its predecessor , it belongs to the branch and bound class of algorithms .
the optimization reduces the effective depth to slightly more than half that of simple minimax if the nodes are evaluated in an optimal or near optimal order ( best choice for side on move ordered first at each node ) .
with an ( average or constant ) branching factor of b , and a search depth of d plies , the maximum number of leaf node positions evaluated ( when the move ordering is pessimal ) is O ( b * b * .
* b ) = O ( bd ) – the same as a simple minimax search .
if the move ordering for the search is optimal ( meaning the best moves are always searched first ) , the number of leaf node positions evaluated is about O ( b * 1 * b * 1 * .
* b ) for odd depth and O ( b * 1 * b * 1 * .
* 1 ) for even depth , or O ( b d / 2 ) = O ( b d ) { \ displaystyle O ( b ^ { d / 2 } ) = O ( { \ sqrt { b ^ { d } } } ) } .
in the latter case , where the ply of a search is even , the effective branching factor is reduced to its square root , or , equivalently , the search can go twice as deep with the same amount of computation .
the explanation of b * 1 * b * 1 * .
this advantage can switch sides many times during the search if the move ordering is incorrect , each time leading to inefficiency .
as the number of positions searched decreases exponentially each move nearer the current position , it is worth spending considerable effort on sorting early moves .
an improved sort at any depth will exponentially reduce the total number of positions searched , but sorting all positions at depths near the root node is relatively cheap as there are so few of them .
in practice , the move ordering is often determined by the results of earlier , smaller searches , such as through iterative deepening .
the algorithm maintains two values , alpha and beta , which represent the maximum score that the maximizing player is assured of and the minimum score that the minimizing player is assured of respectively .
initially alpha is negative infinity and beta is positive infinity , i .
another common , and very cheap , heuristic is the killer heuristic , where the last move that caused a beta-cutoff at the same level in the tree search is always examined first .
this idea can also be generalized into a set of refutation tables .
Alpha – beta search can be made even faster by considering only a narrow search window ( generally determined by guesswork based on experience ) .
this is known as aspiration search .
in the extreme case , the search is performed with alpha and beta equal ; a technique known as zero-window search , null-window search , or scout search .
this is particularly useful for win / loss searches near the end of a game where the extra depth gained from the narrow window and a simple win / loss evaluation function may lead to a conclusive result .
if an aspiration search fails , it is straightforward to detect whether it failed high ( high edge of window was too low ) or low ( lower edge of window was too high ) .
this gives information about what window values might be useful in a re-search of the position .
algorithms like SSS * , on the other hand , use the best-first strategy .
this can potentially make them more time-efficient , but typically at a heavy cost in space-efficiency .

a sexual norm can refer to a personal or a social norm .
based on information gained from sexological studies , a great many ordinary people &apos;s sex lives are very often quite different from popular beliefs about normal , in private .
if non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively , they may be called &quot; sexual freedom &quot; , &quot; sexual liberation &quot; or &quot; free love &quot; .
if they are regarded negatively , they may be called &quot; sexual licence &quot; or &quot; licentiousness &quot; .
restrictive social norms , if judged negatively , are called sexual oppression .
these liberalizing trends can be contrasted with conservative social trends that seek to reverse these patterns of behaviour , with encouragement for young people to choose traditionally accepted roles , beliefs and behaviors , and to exercise sexual abstinence or non-promiscuous lifestyles before marriage .
in such countries there is often strong criticism of non-traditional sexualities and sexual liberation .
some social unrest in both Eastern and Western cultures is due to this conflict between these two trends , and views upon acceptability and control of social and sexual norms .

evidence of whaling in the archipelago was recorded as early as the seventeenth century .
British whaling in the Philippines were reported to have occurred from 1820 to 1840 while American whaling was reported to have happened in 1825 and 1880 alongside local whaling by Filipinos in Bohol .
there was a short period of commercial whaling in the Philippines from 1981 to 1986 .
Philippine whalers fished within Philippine exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) but it was reported that they also hunted Bryde whales in international waters .
the Philippines was also a member of the International Whaling Commission from 1981 to 1988 .
whaling in the Philippines has been illegal since 1991 under Fisheries Administrative Order 185 .
the provision bans the catching , selling , or transporting of dolphins .
the provision was amended in 1997 to include all Cetaceans including whales .
the calls for a ban on whaling and dolphin hunting in the Philippines were raised by both domestic and international groups after local whaling and dolphin hunting traditions of residents of Pamilacan in Bohol were featured in newspapers in the 1990s .
as a compromise for residents of Pamilacan who were dependent on whaling and dolphin hunting , whale and dolphin watching is being promoted in the island as a source of tourism income .
despite the ban , it is believed that the whaling industry in the Philippines did not cease to exist but went underground .

the Chūō Main Line ( 中央本線 , Chūō-honsen ? ) , commonly called the Chūō Line , is one of the major trunk railway lines in Japan .
it connects Tokyo and Nagoya , although it is the slowest direct railway connection between the two cities ; the coastal Tōkaidō Main Line is slightly faster , and the Tōkaidō Shinkansen is the fastest rail link between the cities .
the eastern portion , the Chūō East Line ( 中央東線 , Chūō-tōsen ? ) , is operated by the East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) , while the western portion , the Chūō West Line ( 中央西線 , Chūō-saisen ? ) , is operated by the Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) .
the dividing point between the two companies is Shiojiri Station , where express trains from both operators continue to the Shinonoi Line towards the cities of Matsumoto and Nagano .
compared to the huge urban areas at either end of the Chūō Line , its central portion is very lightly traveled ; the Shiojiri-Nakatsugawa corridor is only served by twice-hourly local and hourly limited express trains .
the Chūō Main Line passes through the mountainous center of Honshu .
its highest point ( near Fujimi Station ) is about 900 meters above sea level and much of the line has a gradient of 25 per mil ( 2 .
5 % or 1 in 40 ) .
along the Chūō East Line section , peaks of the Akaishi and Kiso as well as Mount Yatsugatake can be seen from trains .
the Chūō West Line parallels the old Nakasendō highway ( famous for the preserved post towns of Tsumago-juku and Magome-juku ) and the steep Kiso Valley .
this section lists all stations on the Chūō Main Line and generally explains regional services on the line .
the section between Tokyo and Mitaka is grade-separated , with no level crossings .
between Ochanomizu and Mitaka , the Chūō Main Line has four tracks ; two of them are local tracks ( 緩行線 , kankō-sen ? ) with platforms at every station ; the other two are rapid tracks ( 快速線 , kaisoku-sen ? ) with some stations without platforms .
the local tracks are used by the main line local trains ( operated only in early morning and late night ) and the Chūō-Sōbu Line local trains , while the rapid tracks carry rapid service and limited express trains .
the Tokyo-Mitaka portion is a vital cross-city rail link .
the commuter services on the rapid tracks are collectively called the Chūō Line ( Rapid ) in comparison with the Chūō Line ( Local ) ( 中央線各停 , Chūō-sen-kakutei ? ) or the Chūō-Sōbu Line on the local tracks .
the former is usually referred to simply as the Chūō Line and the latter the Sōbu Line .
this section is located entirely within Tokyo .
the four-track section ends at Mitaka .
plans have been proposed to add another two tracks as far as Tachikawa , but were not included in the track elevation , which was completed between 2008-2011 , with further modifications in 2012 .
this section is also entirely in Tokyo .
for legends on train types , see the preceding section .
most of the rapid service trains from Tokyo terminate at Takao where the line exits the large urban area of Tokyo .
the section between Takao and Ōtsuki still carries some commuter trains as well as long distance local trains and Limited Express trains .
the Kaiji limited express terminates at Kōfu , the capital of Yamanashi Prefecture , while the Azusa and Super Azusa continue beyond Shiojiri to Matsumoto via the Shinonoi Line .
the Okaya-Shiojiri branch is an old route of the Chūō Main Line .
it carries a small number of shuttle trains and trains from / to the Iida Line , which branches off at Tatsuno .
prior to the opening of the new route between Okaya and Shiojiri , there was a junction ( Higashi-Shiojiri Junction ( 東塩尻信号場 ? ) ) between Ono and Shiojiri stations .
it had a reversing layout .
the signal station was closed on October 12 , 1983 .
Shiojiri is the dividing point of the East Line and the West Line ; no train continues from one to the other .
the Shinano limited express is the main service for the rural Shiojiri-Nakatsugawa section .
local and rapid service trains run on the line from Nakatsugawa to Nagoya .

in mechanical engineering , ultimate failure describes the breaking of a material .
in general there are two types of failure : fracture and buckling .
fracture of a material occurs when either an internal or external crack elongates the width or length of the material .
in ultimate failure this will result in one or more breaks in the material .
buckling occurs when compressive loads are applied to the material and instead of cracking the material bows .
this is undesirable because most tools that are designed to be straight will be inadequate if curved .
if the buckling continues , it will create tension on the outer side of the bend and compression on the inner side , potentially fracturing the material .
in engineering there are multiple types of failure based upon the application of the material .
in many machine applications any change in the part due to yielding will result in the machine piece needing to be replaced .
although this deformation or weakening of the material is not the technical definition of ultimate failure , the piece has failed .
in most technical applications pieces are rarely allowed to reach their ultimate failure or breakage point , instead for safety factors they are removed at the first signs of significant wear .
there are two different types of fracture : brittle and ductile .
each of these types of failure occur based on the material &apos;s ductility .
brittle failure occurs with little to no plastic deformation before fracture .
an example of this would be stretching a clay pot or rod , when it is stretched it will not neck or elongate , but merely break into two or more pieces .
while applying a tensile stress to a ductile material , instead of immediately breaking the material will instead elongate .
the material will begin by elongating uniformly until it reaches the yield ( engineering ) point , then the material will begin to neck .
when necking occurs the material will begin to stretch more in the middle and the radius will decrease .
once this begins the material has entered a stage called plastic deformation .
once the material has reached its ultimate tensile strength it will elongate more easily until it reaches ultimate failure and breaks .

Pope Leo V ( died c .
Leo died whilst in prison .
Pope Leo VI ( died February 929 ) was Pope for just over seven months , from June 928 to his death in February 929 .
his pontificate occurred during the period known as the Saeculum obscurum .
Leo VI was born into a Roman family , and his father was Christophorus , who had been Primicerius under Pope John VIII around the year 876 .
tradition has it that he was a member of the Sanguini family .
just immediately prior to his election as pope , Leo had been serving as the Cardinal-Priest of the church of Santa Susanna .
Leo was elected pope around June 928 , during a period of anarchy .
he was chosen by the senatrix Marozia , who had gained control of Rome via the domination of her husband Guy , Margrave of Tuscany , and who had ordered the imprisonment and death of Leo ’ s predecessor , Pope John X.
during his brief pontificate , Leo confirmed the decisions of the Synod of Split .
he completed his predecessor ’ s investigations into the ecclesiastical situation in Dalmatia , and proceeded to give the pallium to John , Archbishop of Salona , and ordered all the bishops of Dalmatia to obey him .
he also ordered the Bishop of Nona and others to limit themselves to the extent of their dioceses .
Leo then issued a ban on castrati entering into a union of marriage .
he also issued an appeal for help against the Arab raiders who were threatening Rome , stating that : .
” Whoever died faithful in this struggle will not see himself refused entry into the heavenly kingdom .
the French chronicler Flodoard said of him : .
Sixtus in Rome , thought to be a Benedictine monk .
most of his bulls were grants of privilege to monasteries , especially including the Abbey of Cluny .
Odo was successful in negotiating a truce after arranging a marriage between Hugh &apos;s daughter Alda and Alberic .
Leo VII also appointed Frederick , Archbishop of Mainz , as a reformer in Germany .
Pope Leo XI ( 2 June 1535 – 27 April 1605 ) , born Alessandro Ottaviano de &apos; Medici , was Pope from 1 to 27 April 1605 .

Pope Lucius III ( c .
1100 – 25 November 1185 ) , born Ubaldo Allucingoli , reigned from 1 September 1181 to his death in 1185 .
1100 ( perhaps 1097 ) as Ubaldo , son of Orlando .
he is commonly referred to as a member of the aristocratic family of Allucingoli , but this is not proven .
he had close ties to the Cistercians , but it seems that he never joined the order .
Pope Adrian IV promoted him to the rank of Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri in December 1158 .
little is known of his early life .
according to the Liber Pontificalis , he was a Roman , and his father &apos;s name was Priscus .
Pope Marinus I ( or Martin II ; died 15 May 884 ) was Pope from 16 December 882 to his death in 884 .

during his pontificate , in October 312 , Constantine defeated Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge and assumed control over Rome .
Constantine presented the pope with the Lateran Palace , which became the papal residence and seat of Christian governance .
he was then invited to the Council of Arles but died before it was held .

he was a legitimate son of Pope Hormisdas , born before his father entered the priesthood .
when Pope Benedict IX was driven from Rome in September 1044 , John , bishop of Sabina , was elected after fierce and protracted infighting .
he took the name Sylvester III in January 1045 .
nearly two years later ( in December 1046 ) , the Council of Sutri deprived him of his bishopric and priesthood and ordered him sent to a monastery .
this sentence was obviously suspended because he continued to function and was recognized as Bishop of Sabina until at least 1062 .
a successor bishop to the see of Sabina is recorded for October 1063 , indicating that John must have died prior to that date .
though some consider him to have been an antipope , Sylvester III continues to be listed as an official Pope ( 1045 ) in Vatican lists .
a similar situation applies to Pope Gregory VI ( 1045 – 1046 ) .
his pontifical name was used again by Antipope Theodoric because , at that time , he was not considered a legitimate pontiff .
Pope Sisinnius ( c .
650 – 4 February 708 ) was Pope from 15 January to his death in 708 .
a Syrian by birth , Sisinnius &apos; father &apos;s name was John .
the paucity of donations to the papacy during his reign ( 42 pounds of gold and 310 pounds of silver , a fraction of the personal donations of other contemporary pontiffs ) indicate that he was probably not from the aristocracy .
Sisinnius was selected as pope during the Byzantine Papacy .

para sa Hopeless Romantic is a 2015 Philippine teen romance film based on the best-selling romantic novel of the same name by Marcelo Santos III .
the film is directed by Andoy Ranay , starring James Reid , Nadine Lustre , Julia Barretto and Iñigo Pascual .
it was distributed by Viva Films and Star Cinema and was released on May 13 , 2015 , in select theaters across the Philippines .
Becca ( Nadine Lustre ) thought that she had everything she could wish for in her life , until Nikko ( James Reid ) broke up with her .
everything in her life starts to fall apart .
to recover , she started writing a story about Ryan ( Inigo Pascual ) , a boy who harbors a secret crush on his best friend Maria ( Julia Barretto ) .
but before he can tell her his real feelings for her , he got into an accident and fell into a coma .
can all four of them find the &quot; happy ending &quot; that each one of them has been hoping for ? .
the film &apos;s release was changed a number of times .
it was originally scheduled to be released in January 2015 , then it was moved to March 2015 .
then finally , Star Cinema changed its original release date and moved it to May 13 , 2015 .
para Sa Hopeless Romantic received mixed reviews from movie critics .
while the rest of romantic comedies seem to be situated in an alternate Philippines where everything is glittered and glossy , giving them all their well-to-do characters reasons to be concerned with love instead of other more pressing things , Ranay ’ s film is set in a world that is more familiar and more palpable .
Cruz also praised lead actress Nadine Lustre &apos;s performance , noting the sincerity in her portrayal of Becca , stating &quot; Lustre makes her character ’ s seemingly unimportant struggle moving .
she laments not being able to move on , to the point of creating grim stories about the futility of love .
she weeps with utmost determination and sincerity , and giggles with glee when presented with an opportunity of finding a brand new romance through ridiculous conversations via chair-bound graffiti .
Philbert Ortiz-Dy of Click the City meanwhile gave a negative review of the film , stating that Para Sa Hopeless Romantic is mainly hopeless .

as a consequence , changing the position of any two particles in the system leads to a completely different configuration of the entire system .
furthermore , there is no restriction on placing more than one particle in any given state accessible to the system .
classical statistics is called Maxwell – Boltzmann statistics ( or M – B statistics ) .
that is , the wave function of the system before interchanging equals the wave function of the system after interchanging .
it is important to emphasize that the wave function of the system has not changed itself .
examples of bosons include photons and helium-4 ( both atoms and nuclei ) .
that is , the wave function of the system before interchanging is the wave function of the system after interchanging , with an overall minus sign .
again , the wave function of the system itself does not change .
the consequence of the negative sign on the Fermi – Dirac statistics can be understood in the following way : .
suppose that the particles that are interchanged belong to the same state .
since the particles are considered indistinguishable from one another then changing the coordinates of the particles should not have any change on the system &apos;s wave function ( because by our assumptions the particles are in the same state ) .
therefore , the wave function before interchanging similar states equals the wave function after interchanging similar states .
combining ( or adding , literally speaking ) the above statement with the fundamental asymmetry of the Fermi – Dirac system leads us to conclude that the wave function of the system before interchanging equals zero .
this shows that in Fermi – Dirac statistics , more than one particle cannot occupy a single state accessible to the system .
it is found that particles with half-integral spin ( or fermions ) obey the Fermi – Dirac statistics .
this includes electrons , protons , helium-3 ( both atoms and nuclei ) etc .

Paul Oscar Blocq ( 1860 – 1896 ) was a French pathologist who is remembered for his neuropathological work done with Jean-Martin Charcot ( 1825-1893 ) and Gheorghe Marinescu ( 1863-1938 ) at the Salpêtrière in Paris .
Blocq and Marinescu were the first physicians to describe extracellular neuritic plaque deposits in the grey matter of the brain .
it is also known as astasia-abasia , and is characterized by the inability to stand or walk , despite the capability to move ones &apos; lower limbs when sitting or lying down .
Paul M.
Pimsleur was born in New York City and grew up in The Bronx .
his father , Solomon Pimsleur , was an immigrant from France and a composer of music ; his American-born mother , Miera , was a librarian at Columbia University .
in French .
his first position involved teaching French phonetics and phonemics at the University of California , Los Angeles .
after leaving UCLA , Pimsleur went on to faculty positions at the Ohio State University , where he taught French and foreign language education .
at the time , the foreign language education program at OSU was the major doctoral program in that field in the U.
while at Ohio State he created and directed the Listening Center , one of the largest language laboratories in the United States .
the center was developed in conjunction with Ohio Bell Telephone and allowed self-paced language study using a series of automated tapes and prompts that were delivered over the telephone .
later , Pimsleur was a professor of education and Romance languages at The State University of New York at Albany , where he held dual professorships in education and French .
he was a Fulbright lecturer at the Ruprecht Karls University of Heidelberg in 1968 and 1969 and a founding member of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages ( ACTFL ) .
he did research on the psychology of language learning and in 1969 was section head of psychology of second languages learning at the International Congress of Applied Linguistics .
his research focused on understanding the language acquisition process , especially the learning process of children , who speak a language without knowing its formal structure .
the term &quot; organic learning &quot; was applied to that phenomenon .
for this , he studied the learning process of groups made of children , adults , and multilingual adults .
the result of this research was the Pimsleur language learning system .
his many books and articles affected theories of language learning and teaching .
in the period from 1958 to 1966 , Pimsleur reviewed previously published studies regarding linguistic and psychological factors involved in language learning .
he also conducted several studies independently .
this led to the publication in 1963 of a coauthored monograph , Underachievement in Foreign Language Learning , which was published by the Modern Language Association of America .
through this research , he identified three factors that could be measured to calculate language learning aptitude : verbal intelligence , auditory ability , and motivation .
Pimsleur and his associates developed the Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery ( PLAB ) based on these three factors to assess language aptitude .
he was one of the first foreign language educators to show an interest in students who have difficulty in learning a foreign language while doing well in other subjects .
today , the PLAB is used to determine the language-learning aptitude , or even a language-learning disability , among secondary-school students .
Pimsleur died unexpectedly of a heart attack during a visit to France in 1976 .

when the disguised Odysseus returns , she announces in her long interview with the disguised hero that whoever can string Odysseus &apos;s rigid bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads may have her hand .
&quot; for the plot of the Odyssey , of course , her decision is the turning point , the move that makes possible the long-predicted triumph of the returning hero &quot; .
other sources ( Duris of Samos ; the Vergilian commentator Servius ) report that Penelope slept with all 108 suitors in Odysseus &apos; absence , and gave birth to Pan as a result .
this myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan &apos;s name ( Πάν ) with the Greek word for &quot; all &quot; ( πᾶν ) .
Penelope is recognizable in Greek and Roman works , from Attic vase-paintings — the Penelope Painter is recognized by his representations of her — to Roman sculpture copying or improvising upon classical Greek models , by her seated pose , by her reflective gesture of leaning her cheek on her hand , and by her protectively crossed knees , reflecting her long chastity in Odysseus &apos; absence , an unusual pose in any other figure .
Latin references to Penelope revolved around the sexual loyalty to her absent husband .
it suited the marital aspect of Roman society representing the tranquility of the worthy family .
she is mentioned by various classical authors including Plautus , Propertius , Horace , Ovid , Martial and Statius .
the use of Penelope in Latin texts provided a basis for her ongoing use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a representation of the chaste wife .
this was reinforced by her being named by Saint Jerome among pagan women famed for their chastity .

deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea .
such dry conditions favored gymnosperms , plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover , over plants such as ferns that disperse spores in a wetter environment .
the first modern trees ( conifers , ginkgos and cycads ) appeared in the Permian .
state of Texas is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world .
the climate in the Permian was quite varied .
at the start of the Permian , the Earth was still in an Ice Age , which began in the Carboniferous .
glaciers receded around the mid-Permian period as the climate gradually warmed , drying the continent &apos;s interiors .
in the late Permian period , the drying continued although the temperature cycled between warm and cool cycles .
Permian marine deposits are rich in fossil mollusks , echinoderms , and brachiopods .
fossilized shells of two kinds of invertebrates are widely used to identify Permian strata and correlate them between sites : fusulinids , a kind of shelled amoeba-like protist that is one of the foraminiferans , and ammonoids , shelled cephalopods that are distant relatives of the modern nautilus .
by the close of the Permian , trilobites and a host of other marine groups became extinct .
terrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants , fungi , arthropods , and various types of tetrapods .
the period saw a massive desert covering the interior of Pangaea .
the warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere , where extensive dry desert appeared .
the rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides , the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover .
a number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements .
the Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing .
about the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began .
the swamp-loving lycopod trees of the Carboniferous , such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria , were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced seed ferns and early conifers .
at the close of the Permian , lycopod and equisete swamps reminiscent of Carboniferous flora survived only on a series of equatorial islands in the Paleotethys Sea that later would become South China .
the Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups , including the ancestors of many present-day families .
rich forests were present in many areas , with a diverse mix of plant groups .
the southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the Glossopteris flora .
oxygen levels were probably high there .
the ginkgos and cycads also appeared during this period .
from the Pennsylvanian Subperiod of the Carboniferous period until well into the Permian , the most successful insects were primitive relatives of cockroaches .
six fast legs , four well-developed folding wings , fairly good eyes , long , well-developed antennae ( olfactory ) , an omnivorous digestive system , a receptacle for storing sperm , a chitin-based exoskeleton that could support and protect , as well as a form of gizzard and efficient mouth parts , gave it formidable advantages over other herbivorous animals .
about 90 % of insects at the start of the Permian were cockroach-like insects ( &quot; Blattopterans &quot; ) .
primitive forms of dragonflies ( Odonata ) were the dominant aerial predators and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well .
true Odonata appeared in the Permian , and all are effectively semi-aquatic insects ( aquatic immature stages , and terrestrial adults ) , as are all modern odonates .
their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils , dating back to the Devonian , and are different in several respects from the wings of other insects .
fossils suggest they may have possessed many modern attributes even by the late Carboniferous , and it is possible that they captured small vertebrates , for at least one species had a wing span of 71 centimetres ( 28 in ) .
several other insect groups appeared during the Permian , including the Coleoptera ( beetles ) and Hemiptera ( true bugs ) .
early Permian terrestrial faunas were dominated by pelycosaurs , diadectes and amphibians , the middle Permian by primitive therapsids such as the dinocephalia , and the late Permian by more advanced therapsids such as gorgonopsians and dicynodonts .
another group of therapsids , the therocephalians ( such as Lycosuchus ) , arose in the Middle Permian .
a group of small reptiles , the diapsids started to abound .
these were the ancestors to most modern reptiles and the ruling dinosaurs as well as pterosaurs and crocodiles .
Permian amphibians consisted of temnospondyli , lepospondyli and batrachosaurs .
Edaphosaurus pogonias and Platyhystrix – Early Permian , North America and Europe .
Dimetrodon grandis and Eryops – Early Permian , North America .
ocher fauna , Estemmenosuchus uralensis and Eotitanosuchus – Middle Permian , Ural Region .
Titanophoneus and Ulemosaurus – Ural Region .
the Permian ended with the most extensive extinction event recorded in paleontology : the Permian-Triassic extinction event .
90 % to 95 % of marine species became extinct , as well as 70 % of all land organisms .
based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period , the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius .
another hypothesis involves ocean venting of hydrogen sulfide gas .
portions of the deep ocean will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas .
if enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an anoxic zone , the gas can rise into the atmosphere .
oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas , but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available .
hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years .
models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas .
of course , there are species that can metabolize hydrogen sulfide .
another hypothesis builds on the flood basalt eruption theory .
an increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would not be enough to explain the death of 95 % of life .
the crater is located at a depth of 1 .
6 kilometers beneath the ice of Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica .
they also speculate that it may have contributed in some way to the separation of Australia from the Antarctic landmass , which were both part of a supercontinent called Gondwana .

in the Christian Bible , the term Seven Spirits of God appears four times in the Book of Revelation .
the meaning of this term has been interpreted in multiple ways .
the seven Spirits of God are mentioned four times in the Book of Revelation , and in the book of Isaiah it names each Spirit .
in one interpretation , the &quot; Seven Spirits &quot; represent the sevenfold ministry of the Spirit as depicted in the Book of Isaiah .
the reference to the lamb in Revelation 5 : 6 relates it to the Seven Spirits which first appear in Revelation 1 : 4 and are associated with Jesus who holds them along with seven stars .
an alternative view is that the seven graces ( &quot; charisma &quot; ) of Romans 12 : 6-8 reflect the seven spirits of God .
the Holy Spirit manifests in humankind through these graces , reflecting the seven spirits of Yahweh .
the seven graces are : 1 ) insight ( prophecy ) ; 2 ) helpfulness ( service or ministry ) ; 3 ) instruction ( teaching ) ; 4 ) encouragement ; 5 ) generosity ( giving ) ; 6 ) guidance ( leadership ) ; and 7 ) compassion .
&quot; Dynamis &quot; is used by the Apostle Paul to refer to spiritual beings in Romans 8 : 38 ; Ephesians 1 : 21 , 3 : 10 , 6 : 12 ; and Colossians 1 : 16 , 2 : 10 &amp; 15 .
&quot; powers and principalities &quot; can apply to both angelic and demonic beings , but more often in the New Testament to demonic beings .
however , it should be noted , most modern Protestant translators take &quot; Dynamis &quot; to mean &apos; strength &apos; , &apos; power &apos; or &apos; ability &apos; , whereas the ancient and modern Catholic conception of activity or power was often understood as &apos; virtues &apos; .
sevenfold may also be connected with the Biblical understanding of the number 7 representing perfection .
the &quot; Seven Fold Spirit of God &quot; could be the &quot; perfect &quot; Spirit of God , the Holy Spirit .

Croatian scientist Stjepan Mohorovičić predicted the existence of positronium in a 1934 article published in Astronomische Nachrichten , in which he called it the &quot; electrum &quot; .
it was experimentally discovered by Martin Deutsch at MIT in 1951 and became known as positronium .
the first observation of di-positronium molecules — molecules consisting of two positronium atoms — was reported on 12 September 2007 by David Cassidy and Allen Mills from University of California , Riverside .
positronium in high energy states has been predicted to be the dominant form of atomic matter in the universe in the far future , if proton decay is a reality .

the Muratorian fragment is a copy of perhaps the oldest known list of most of the books of the New Testament .
the fragment consists of all that remains of a section of a list of all the works that were accepted as canonical by the churches known to its original compiler .
it was discovered in the Ambrosian Library in Milan by Father Ludovico Antonio Muratori ( 1672 – 1750 ) , the most famous Italian historian of his generation , and published in 1740 .
of the General epistles , the author accepts the Epistle of Jude and says that two epistles &quot; bearing the name of John are counted in the catholic church &quot; ; 1 and 2 Peter and James are not mentioned in the fragment .
it is clear that the author assumed that the author of the Gospel of John was the same as the author of the First Epistle of John , for in the middle of discussing the Gospel of John he says &quot; what marvel then is it that John brings forward these several things so constantly in his epistles also , saying in his own person , &quot; What we have seen with our eyes and heard with our ears , and our hands have handled that have we written , &quot; ( 1 John 1 : 1 ) which is a quotation from the First Epistle of John .
it is not clear whether the other epistle in question is 2 John or 3 John .
another indication that the author identified the Gospel writer John with two epistles bearing John &apos;s name is that when he specifically addresses the epistles of John , he writes , &quot; the Epistle of Jude indeed , and the two belonging to the above mentioned John .
&quot; in other words , he thinks that these letters were written by the John whom he has already discussed , namely John the gospel writer .

Prascorsano is a comune ( municipality ) in the Province of Turin in the Italian region Piedmont , located about 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) north of Turin .
Prasutagus was king of a British Celtic tribe called the Iceni , who inhabited roughly what is now Norfolk , in the 1st century AD .
he is best known as the husband of Boudica .
Prasutagus may have been one of the eleven kings who surrendered to Claudius following the Roman conquest in 43 , or he may have been installed as king following the defeat of a rebellion of the Iceni in 47 .
as an ally of Rome his tribe were allowed to remain nominally independent , and to ensure this Prasutagus named the Roman emperor as co-heir to his kingdom , along with his two daughters .
Boudica was flogged and their daughters raped .
Roman financiers called in their loans .
all this led to the revolt of the Iceni , under the leadership of Boudica , in 60 or 61 .
coins have been found in Suffolk inscribed SVB ESVPRASTO ESICO FECIT , &quot; under Esuprastus Esico made ( this ) &quot; in Latin .
some archaeologists believe that Esuprastus was the true name of the king Tacitus calls Prasutagus , while others think he was a different person .
others interpret Esuprastus is a compound name , with &quot; Esu- &quot; deriving from the god Esus and meaning &quot; lord &quot; , &quot; master &quot; or &quot; honour &quot; , and &quot; Prasto- &quot; being an abbreviated personal name , the coin inscription thus meaning &quot; under Lord Prasto- &quot; .
it is also notable that coins of the Corieltauvi have been found inscribed with the similar names IISVPRASV and ESVPASV .
the name of an earlier king of the Iceni appears on coins as SCAVO , a name which may be related to the Latin scaeva , &quot; left &quot; , and scaevola , &quot; left-handed &quot; .
both rulers &apos; coins are similarly Roman in style and language and were probably issued within twenty years of each other .
Chris Rudd suggests that Esuprastus , whom he identifies with Prasutagus , succeeded Scavo after the Icenian rebellion of 47 .

frying is believed to have first appeared in the Ancient Egyptian kitchen , during the Old Kingdom , around 2500 BCE .
the spiders are bred in holes in the ground in villages north of Skuon , or foraged for in nearby forestland , and fried in oil .
it is not clear how this practice started , but some have suggested that the population might have started eating spiders out of desperation during the years of Khmer Rouge rule , when food was in short supply .
the spiders are a species of tarantula called &quot; a-ping &quot; in Khmer , and are about the size of a human palm .
the snacks cost about 300 riel each in 2002 , or about US $ 0 .
one travel book identifies them as Haplopelma albostriatum , also known as the Thai zebra tarantula , and notes that the same species &apos; common name has been the &quot; edible spider &quot; for more than a hundred years .
the popularity of the dish is , however , a recent phenomenon , starting perhaps as late as the 1990s .
the same book details a recipe : the spiders are tossed in a mixture of MSG , sugar , and salt ; crushed garlic is fried in oil until fragrant , then the spiders are added and fried alongside the garlic until &quot; the legs are almost completely stiff , by which time the contents of the abdomen are not so runny .
the taste has been described as bland , &quot; rather like a cross between chicken and cod &quot; , with a contrast in texture from a crispy exterior to a soft centre .
the legs contain little flesh , while the head and body have &quot; a delicate white meat inside &quot; .
there are certainly those who might not enjoy the abdomen , however , as it contains a brown paste consisting of organs , possibly eggs , and excrement .
some call it a delicacy while others recommend not eating it .

pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli .
pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as &quot; the captain of the men of death &quot; .
in the elderly , confusion may be the most prominent sign .
bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually present with similar symptoms .
some causes are associated with classic , but non-specific , clinical characteristics .
pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain , diarrhea , or confusion , while pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum , and pneumonia caused by Klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as &quot; currant jelly &quot; .
bloody sputum ( known as hemoptysis ) may also occur with tuberculosis , Gram-negative pneumonia , and lung abscesses as well as more commonly with acute bronchitis .
Mycoplasma pneumonia may occur in association with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck , joint pain , or a middle ear infection .
although there are more than 100 strains of infectious agents identified , only a few are responsible for the majority of the cases .
a causative agent may not be isolated in approximately half of cases despite careful testing .
the use of acid-suppressing medications — such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers — is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia .
bacteria are the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) , with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50 % of cases .
other commonly isolated bacteria include Haemophilus influenzae in 20 % , Chlamydophila pneumoniae in 13 % , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3 % of cases ; Staphylococcus aureus ; Moraxella catarrhalis ; Legionella pneumophila and Gram-negative bacilli .
a number of drug-resistant versions of the above infections are becoming more common , including drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae ( DRSP ) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) .
the spreading of organisms is facilitated when risk factors are present .
commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses , coronaviruses , influenza virus , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , adenovirus , and parainfluenza .
herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia , except in groups such as : newborns , persons with cancer , transplant recipients , and people with significant burns .
it is most often caused by Histoplasma capsulatum , blastomyces , Cryptococcus neoformans , Pneumocystis jiroveci ( pneumocystis pneumonia ) , and Coccidioides immitis .
histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin , and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States .
the number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population .
a variety of parasites can affect the lungs , including Toxoplasma gondii , Strongyloides stercoralis , Ascaris lumbricoides , and Plasmodium malariae .
in other infections , such as malaria , lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation .
idiopathic interstitial pneumonia or noninfectious pneumonia is a class of diffuse lung diseases .
they include diffuse alveolar damage , organizing pneumonia , nonspecific interstitial pneumonia , lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia , desquamative interstitial pneumonia , respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease , and usual interstitial pneumonia .
other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose .
the invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death .
when the immune system responds to the infection , even more lung damage may occur .
primarily white blood cells , mainly mononuclear cells , generate the inflammation .
half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep .
bacteria can spread also via the blood .
once in the lungs , bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli , where the macrophages and neutrophils ( defensive white blood cells ) attempt to inactivate the bacteria .
the neutrophils also release cytokines , causing a general activation of the immune system .
this leads to the fever , chills , and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia .
pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and a chest X-ray .
a rapid respiratory rate is defined as greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old , 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old , or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old .
in children , increased respiratory rate and lower chest indrawing are more sensitive than hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope .
physical examination may sometimes reveal low blood pressure , high heart rate , or low oxygen saturation .
the respiratory rate may be faster than normal , and this may occur a day or two before other signs .
crackles ( rales ) may be heard over the affected area during inspiration .
a chest radiograph is frequently used in diagnosis .
if a person is sufficiently sick to require hospitalization , a chest radiograph is recommended .
X-ray presentations of pneumonia may be classified as lobar pneumonia , bronchopneumonia ( also known as lobular pneumonia ) , and interstitial pneumonia .
bacterial , community-acquired pneumonia classically show lung consolidation of one lung segmental lobe , which is known as lobar pneumonia .
however , findings may vary , and other patterns are common in other types of pneumonia .
radiographs of viral pneumonia may appear normal , appear hyper-inflated , have bilateral patchy areas , or present similar to bacterial pneumonia with lobar consolidation .
Radiologic findings may not be present in the early stages of the disease , especially in the presence of dehydration , or may be difficult to be interpreted in the obese or those with a history of lung disease .
a CT scan can give additional information in indeterminate cases .
testing for other specific organisms may be recommended during outbreaks , for public health reasons .
the causative agent is determined in only 15 % of cases with routine microbiological tests .
pneumonitis refers to lung inflammation ; pneumonia refers to pneumonitis , usually due to infection but sometimes non-infectious , that has the additional feature of pulmonary consolidation .
recommended for hospital-acquired pneumonia include third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins , carbapenems , fluoroquinolones , aminoglycosides , and vancomycin .

in September 1991 , the electorate approved changes to the constitution , formally creating a parliamentary system and returning governing power to the office of the prime minister , as in Bangladesh &apos;s original constitution .
in October 1991 , members of parliament elected a new head of state , President Abdur Rahman Biswas .
Khaleda Zia served as Prime Minister of Bangladesh three times , since 1991 .
in 12 June 1996 polls , BNP lost to Sheikh Hasina &apos;s Awami League but emerged as the largest opposition party in the country &apos;s parliamentary history with 116 seats .
in the 2001 general elections BNP won the election with a two-third majority of seats in parliament and 46 % of the vote ( compared to the principal opposition party &apos;s 40 % ) and Khaleda Zia was once again sworn in as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh .
Sheikh Hasina took the oath as the prime minister of Bangladesh .
she vowed to create a Government of National Unity .
though some smaller parties and a few individuals from BNP did join the government , the distance between the main two political parties as well as their leaders remained as large as ever .
Awami League was defeated in the 2001 Parliament election .
it won only 62 seats in the Parliament , while the Four-Party Alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party won more than 200 seats , giving them a two-third majority in the Parliament .
Sheikh Hasina herself was defeated from a constituency in Rangpur , which happened to contain her husband &apos;s hometown , but won from three other seats .
Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League rejected the results , claiming that the election was rigged with the help of the President and the Caretaker government .
however , the international community was largely satisfied with the elections and the Four-Party Alliance went on to form the government .
in the December 2008 election , Sheikh Hasina &apos;s Awami league got a landslide victory winning 230 seats , which gave them the two-thirds majority in the parliament .
she made an alliance with JP and left fronts and her grand alliance won 252 seats in the parliament .
Sheikh Hasina took oath as Prime Minister on 6 January 2009 .
the scheduled 22 January 2007 elections were marred by controversy .
the Awami League and its allies protested , saying that the elections would not be fair because of alleged bias by the caretaker government in favour of Khaleda Zia and the BNP .
Hasina demanded that the head of the caretaker government , President Iajuddin Ahmed , step down from that position , and on 3 January 2007 , she announced that the Awami League and its allies would boycott the elections .
later in the month , the military led by Army Chief General Moinuddin Ahmed intervened and President Iajuddin Ahmed was asked to resign as the Chief Advisor .
he was also made to declare a state of emergency .
a new military-controlled Caretaker government was formed with Dr.
Fakhruddin Ahmed as the Chief Adviser .
the scheduled parliamentary election was postponed .
on 12 January 2007 , President Iajuddin Ahmed swore in Fakhruddin Ahmed as the Chief Adviser to the Interim Caretaker Government .
for a country widely perceived as one of the world &apos;s most corrupt , the most dramatic aspect of Fakhruddin Ahmed &apos;s rule is his antigraft campaign against the establishment .
so far , more than 160 senior politicians , top civil servants and security officials have been arrested on suspicion of graft and other economic crimes .
the roundup has netted former ministers from the two main political parties , including former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina and former adviser Fazlul Haque .

school Rumble ( スクールランブル , Sukūru Ranburu ? ) is a Japanese shōnen manga series written and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi .
first serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine from October 22 , 2002 to July 23 , 2008 , all 345 chapters were later collected in 22 tankōbon volumes by Kodansha .
magazine Special published School Rumble Z monthly from August 20 , 2008 to May 20 , 2009 .
a romance comedy centering on relationships between Japanese high school students , School Rumble focuses on a love triangle involving the series &apos; two protagonists , Tenma Tsukamoto and Kenji Harima , and one of their classmates , Oji Karasuma .
the series often discards realism in favor of comedic effect .
TV Tokyo broadcast a 26-episode anime program between October 2004 and April 2005 .
in December 2005 , a two-part original video animation ( OVA ) entitled School Rumble : extra Class was released .
a second season , School Rumble : 2nd Semester , aired between April and September 2006 .
finally , two more episodes , collectively entitled School Rumble : third Semester , were bundled with the Japanese manga volumes 21 and 22 .
three video games have been produced — two for the PlayStation 2 in July 2005 and July 2006 , and one for the PlayStation Portable in 2005 .
two light novels written by Hiroko Tokita and illustrated by Kobayashi were published in April 2004 and December 2007 ; four official guidebooks illustrated by Kobayashi and written by his editors have also been released .
del Rey Manga publishes the English translation of School Rumble .
in the translation , Del Rey Manga maintained the traditional Japanese name order &#91; n 1 &#93; to preserve puns based on the characters &apos; names .
Funimation published the first and second anime seasons and the Extra Class OVAs in English .
school Rumble has been translated into additional languages , although the final two episodes , the video games , and guidebooks have yet to be released outside Japan .
the manga was well received by Japanese-language readers ; several volumes have appeared in the top manga sales charts .
the North American English translations were less popular , but still ranked several times in the top 100 as well as ranking 145th for overall manga series sales in 2008 .
critics of the English-language translation have been positive overall , praising Kobayashi for his art style and overall use of humor .
however , the manga has received some criticism , mostly centered on some of the jokes and repetitive plot .
the anime adaptation also sold well in Japan and was praised by Kobayashi and — for the English-language translation — critics .
the decision by Media Factory to aggressively pursue its intellectual property rights for School Rumble is believed by proponents of fansubs to have had a negative impact on the franchise &apos;s release and sales in the North American market .
school Rumble is a romantic shōnen comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School , along with their friends and families .
the main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto , an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric , enigmatic , nice-guy classmate , Oji Karasuma .
Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma .
he remains oblivious to her interest , instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry .
the main male protagonist , delinquent Kenji Harima , similarly yearns for Tenma , attending school solely to be near her .
like Tenma , Harima has difficulty declaring his love , and whenever he summons the courage to do so , circumstances conspire against him .
Harima complicates the love triangle through constant bumbling , and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation .
Harima becomes involved with Tenma &apos;s close friend , Eri Sawachika , after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations .
later in the series , he develops a friendship with Tenma &apos;s younger sister , Yakumo Tsukamoto , who becomes Harima &apos;s assistant on a manga he writes .
the plots of Harima &apos;s stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations , usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma .
after the hero saves the heroine , she always falls in love with him .
Yakumo &apos;s relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C &apos;s student representative , Haruki Hanai , who has a crush on Yakumo , with the sisters &apos; shared surname causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others &apos; respective infatuations .
&#91; N 2 &#93; Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma , her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses , and Harima &apos;s bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger .
eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love , but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory .
his amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma &apos;s life ; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma .
although School Rumble focuses on Harima and Tenma , the series explores a number of supporting characters .
these include Tenma &apos;s friends Mikoto Suo , who runs a kenpo dojo where her childhood friend , Hanai , trains , and Akira Takano , a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl .
as the story progresses , more major characters are introduced into the relationship web .
at this point most of the plot-lines are settled , but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists .
Karasuma still suffers from memory loss , and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri , their relationship status remains the same .
Jin Kobayashi began writing School Rumble , his debut work , in 2002 .
&#91; N 3 &#93; He stated to an audience at Honolulu &apos;s 2006 Kawaii Kon convention that he started writing the series because he found the idea of a manga involving a delinquent falling in love interesting .
Kobayashi &apos;s favorite character , Kenji Harima , is based largely on an amalgam of various friends , although he estimates &quot; about 30 % &quot; of Harima is a reflection of himself .
however , despite putting most of his personal feelings into the female characters , he stated that Ryuuhei Suga , a minor supporting character , is the most autobiographical .
most of the other characters are based on memories of former high-school classmates ; Kobayashi recalled that he had no real idea of their voices when drawing them , and it was not until much later , when he heard the voice actors &apos; interpretations during the production of the anime series , that he knew how they should sound .
he acknowledged that some characters are more developed than others ; in reply to a fan question about the mysterious Akira Takano , he admitted that , despite the closeness he feels for her , he did not put much emphasis on Takano and planned to develop her love-life slowly .
Kobayashi intentionally centered his story arcs around misunderstandings which he then resolves , since he believes &quot; if there &apos;s no misunderstanding then there &apos;s no funny story .
&quot; he claims that none of his stories are based on real-life events , although when pressed admits the possibility of some resemblances but without divulging specific details .
Kobayashi and his editors collaborated on the plotlines .
Kobayashi would then draw the basic illustrations for each chapter before passing his material to assistants to finish .
as the series &apos; manga artist , Kobayashi also designed the cover art .
originally , the fifth volume &apos;s front cover was to feature Akira Takano , but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since much of its plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo , she should be on the cover instead .
desiring to feature a male character , he placed Harima on the cover of volume six .
Kobayashi designed a poster to commemorate the ending of the series with the final chapter of School Rumble Z.
an anime adaptation of the series was never envisaged by Kobayashi , and he was skeptical of the project when first approached .
negotiations and preparation took some time , but he claims to be happy with the end result .
on viewing the first anime footage , Kobayashi was astonished ; he recalls in an interview his emotions at the time , stating &quot; I was incredibly touched by it .
completely overcome .
&quot; impressed with the adaptation of his work , he praises the anime staff for their achievement , although conceding that School Rumble probably lent itself to the anime format .
he cites the fishing episode , for which he supplied the voice acting for several minor parts , as his favorite .
&#91; N 4 &#93; .
Kobayashi allowed the voice actors who voiced his characters significant freedom to interpret them as they chose .
there were a number of cast changes throughout the production ; Ami Koshimizu , the voice actress for Tenma , had initially auditioned for the role of Yakumo , and between School Rumble &apos;s first and second seasons the voice actors for both Karen Ichijo and Yoko Sasakura were replaced .
Mako Sakurai took over Karen &apos;s role from Yuuka Nanri , and Aya Hirano replaced Akiko Kurumado as Yoko .
the artbox design for Funimation &apos;s North American release of the School Rumble anime resembles a miniature metal locker , and each of the individually released DVDs comes with heavy duty magnets .
the discs include subtitled interviews with the Japanese voice actors , which were compiled onto a third DVD for the full first season release .
in 2007 , Funimation ran a drawing contest prior to releasing the anime in North America .
the grand prize included a new computer with software for developing anime and manga .
the United Kingdom anime release by Revelation Films saw the same limited edition box as Funimation , along with two standard editions .
Jin Kobayashi wrote and illustrated both School Rumble and School Rumble Z.
school Rumble was serialized by Kodansha in Weekly Shōnen Magazine from October 2002 to July 2008 .
it further appeared in issues of Shōnen Magazine &apos;s Magazine Special , and comprised one chapter of the seasonal Shōnen Magazine Wonder ( 少年マガジンワンダー ? ) .
the collected works were released in Japan by Kodansha .
school Rumble Z was produced in Magazine Special from August 2008 to May 2009 .
concluding the series , a compiled volume was released on June 17 , 2009 .
as a guide to the contents of each chapter , musical notations were added before the chapter number .
in School Rumble , chapters marked with a sharp sign ( ♯ ) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima , while side stories dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a flat sign ( ♭ ) .
the one exception to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in Shōnen Magazine Wonder , which uses the natural sign ( ♮ ) .
school Rumble Z uses the natural sign for every chapter .
the manga volumes of School Rumble contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation ; these are normally one page in length , but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page telling a self-contained story .
del Rey Manga , in North America , and Tanoshimi in the United Kingdom licensed School Rumble for an English-language release .
it has also been translated into other languages , although the German-language release which Tokyopop initially published was cancelled and later continued by Egmont Manga &amp; Anime .
del Rey released the first English-language volume on February 28 , 2006 , and the latest — volumes 14-16 in an omnibus — on July 27 , 2010 .
following Kodansha &apos;s lead , the Del Rey translation places the main plot chapters first followed by the side stories .
del Rey also retained the Japanese naming order to preserve puns and humor involving the names of the characters .
TV Tokyo adapted the School Rumble manga for two 26-episode television sketch show series , and five additional episodes .
the first season was broadcast in Japan from October 10 , 2004 to March 29 , 2005 , followed by two original video animation ( OVA ) episodes entitled School Rumble : extra Class ( スクールランブルOVA一学期補習 , School Rumble OVA Ichigakki Hoshū ? ) , which were released on December 22 , 2005 .
the second season , School Rumble : 2nd Semester ( スクールランブル二学期 , School Rumble Nigakki ? ) , ran from April 2 to September 24 , 2006 .
although a third series — School Rumble : third Semester ( スクールランブル三学期 , School Rumble Sangakki ? ) — was drawn up in the form of 24 episode synopses , the series was never animated .
instead a two-episode mini-series was released as episodes 25 and 26 of School Rumble : third Semester .
the first 24 episodes follow the manga &apos;s storyline between the end of School Rumble : 2nd Semester and the Third Semester mini-series ; the promotional videos of the mini-series on the anime &apos;s website instead of previews of a new season confirmed that the remaining 24 episodes would not be animated .
the School Rumble : third Semester episodes were released with special editions of volumes 21 and 22 of the School Rumble manga , the first on July 17 and the second on September 17 , 2008 .
school Rumble , School Rumble : 2nd Semester , and School Rumble : extra Class were later licensed for an English-language audience by Funimation in North America , Madman Entertainment in Australasia and the first three volumes of season one by Revelation Films in the United Kingdom .
on September 1 , 2009 Funimation re-released School Rumble : first Semester and Extra class as a compilation .
2nd Semester was re-released as an entire season with a new rating of TV-MA .
the anime has also been released in other languages , and Funimation have made several dubbed episodes of School Rumble and School Rumble : 2nd Semester available as streaming content on the Internet .
the Funimation Channel began airing the first season of School Rumble on September 1 , 2008 .
the 2008 &apos;s Future Film Festival in Bologna , Italy screened School Rumble : 2nd Semester .
the anime &apos;s first season focuses on Tenma , Harima , and Karasuma , and Harima &apos;s relationships with other females including Sawachika and Yakumo .
its second season involves more of the secondary cast .
the Extra Class OVAs are compiled from various first season storylines .
both the Third Semester synopses and episodes return to the main cast .
the anime &apos;s structure has been compared to Azumanga Daioh , with thematic influences from Full Metal Panic ? Fumoffu .
in places it makes deliberate use of unconventional nomenclature ; the title of episode 25 of season one is a set of pictograms , while episode 26 &apos;s title has 187 characters in the Japanese original .
in season two , the Japanese title for episode 26 consists of just a period .
the narrative of the School Rumble anime is designed to mirror that of the manga , which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection .
shown from the perspective of its characters — notably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affection — the anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle , with jokes that work on multiple levels .
one such example , highlighted by Lisa Marie , reviewer for Anime Today , is the bike chase scene in episode 1 of season one .
she notes that while anyone can appreciate the chase &apos;s inherent humor , those familiar with Initial D will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference .
Lisa Marie comments &quot; I certainly admit watching an insane bike chase cross paths with Initial D &apos;s famous AE86 has a bit more cachet when you know why there &apos;s a cheesily rendered race car in slow moving Eurobeat .
two anime soundtracks and five maxi single albums based on the anime &apos;s opening and closing themes have been released , with all but the second season &apos;s closing theme having both a regular and limited edition .
in addition , three two-disc drama CDs and three radio dramas have been released on CD .
eight image albums — one for each of the main characters — have also been released , in both a regular and limited edition run .
on December 5 , 2004 , Yokohama BLITZ held a concert entitled School Rumble PRESENTS Come ! come ! well-come ? party ( スクールランブル プレゼンツ Come ! come ! well-come ? party ? ) , featuring the voice acting cast of School Rumble .
the event was released on DVD on March 24 , 2005 .
announced around the time of the Japanese release of volume 15 , from July 21 through July 25 , 2005 a stage play called School Rumble Super Oshibai School Rumble – Osarusan dayo Harima-kun ! - ( School Rumble スーパーお芝居スクールランブル 〜 お猿さんだよ 、 播磨くん ! 〜 ? ) recapping Season 1 of School Rumble was performed .
it was released on DVD on October 10 , 2005 .
unicorn Table , the soundtrack artists for School Rumble , performed songs from the anime from December 7 – 9 , 2007 at the New York Anime Festival , and again on April 26 , 2008 at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester , New York for the Tora-Con anime convention .
three video games based on School Rumble have been developed and released in Japan .
marvelous Entertainment published the first game for the PlayStation 2 entitled School Rumble : sleep Helps a Girl Grow ( スクールランブル ねる娘は育つ ? , School Rumble : neru Ko wa Sodatsu ) on July 21 , 2005 .
it was later reissued on August 10 , 2006 , as a The Best range budget release .
marvelous Entertainment released a second game , entitled School Rumble : 2nd Semester – Summer Training Camp ( of fear ? ) ! ! Ghost &apos;s Appearing in the Western-styled Building ! ? fighting Over the Treasure ! ! ! ( スクールランブル二学期 恐怖の ( ? ) 夏合宿 ! 洋館に幽霊現る ! ? お宝を巡って真っ向勝負 ! ! ! の巻 ? , School Rumble Nigakki Kyōfu no ( ? ) Natsugasshuku ! yōkan ni Yūrei Arawaru ! ? Otakara o Megutte Makkō Shōbu ! ! ! no Maki ) on July 20 , 2006 , also for the PlayStation 2 .
the story revolves around the School Rumble cast hearing a rumor of treasure hidden within a mansion .
two versions were produced ; a regular and a limited edition , the latter of which included a drama CD , memorial album , and a special box with variant cover art .
on June 28 , 2007 , this game was also re-released as a &quot; Best Collection &quot; .
school Rumble : SIS , This is serious ! ( スクールランブル 姉さん事件です ! ? , School Rumble : Nēsan Jiken Desu ! ) , published on July 7 , 2005 for the PlayStation Portable by Bandai .
it has an original story based around Karasuma suffering a sudden collapse .
although the story centers on Tenma , the player can take the perspective of other characters to obtain clues for solving the mystery .
school Rumble has been the basis of two light novels and four guidebooks .
the light novels , School Rumble : Koi , Shirisomeshi koro ni ( スクールランブル 〜 恋 、 知りそめし頃に 〜 ? ) and School Rumble : me wa Megarodon no Me ( スクールランブル 〜 メはメガロドンのメ 〜 , School Rumble : me is Me for Megalodon ? ) , were written by Hiroko Tokita and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi and published in April 2004 and December 2007 respectively .
they were later translated by Tong Li Comics into Traditional Chinese .
Jin Kobayashi and his editors also wrote and illustrated four official guidebooks for the series : school Rumble : private File , School Rumble : official File , School Rumble : pleasure File , and School Rumble : treasure File .
school Rumble has spawned lots of merchandise featuring its characters , including T-shirts and figurines .
in 2004 , School Rumble &apos;s Japanese license holder , Media Factory , declared its titles off-limits to fan-made subtitled translations — a practice known as fansubbing .
the directory website AnimeSuki later removed all links to fansubs of Media Factory &apos;s work in response to a cease-and-desist notice issued by the license holder , although fansub group &apos; Wannabe Fansubs &apos; continued their fansubbing regardless .
media Factory-owned anime has been the subject of debate over the validity of fansubbing practice .
proponents believe School Rumble would have more quickly received an English license had fansubs been allowed to circulate more freely , generating viewer interest .
the School Rumble manga had a successful sales run in Japan and the North American English market .
in Japan , several volumes managed to chart : volume 13 was the ninth best-selling manga for the week of June 21 , 2006 , before falling to tenth the following week ; Volume 15 reached 4th place for the week of December 20 , also falling to 10th the following week ; and Volume 17 came 7th for the week of June 20 , 2007 , subsequently dropping to 9th .
school Rumble Z ranked 18th for the week of June 15 , 2009 .
del Rey &apos;s North American translation sold well , although not quite as well as in Japan .
volume 3 was ranked 99th in September 2006 ; volume 4 was 96th in December ; volume 5 was 98th in April 2007 ; volume 12 was 141st in November 2008 ; and volume 12 was 169th in May 2009 .
overall the series ranked as the 145th best-selling English translated manga series for 2008 .
similarly , the anime adaptation of School Rumble also sold very well in Japan according to the Oricon charts .
the Japanese DVD release of First Semester saw fluctuating sales for each volume with each charting within the top 45 .
volumes 1 and 5 have the best showings at five times at 15 and twice at 17 respectively , while the final three volumes ( 7 through 9 ) were the least successful with volume 8 being the lowest ranking twice at 45 .
while the 2nd Semester continued to sell well , overall sales did not chart as well as the previous season .
most of the DVDs ranked in the a range from 50s to 70s and all of them ranked just twice .
volume 1 ranked the best at 41 , followed by volume 4 at 49 ; volume 6 ranked lowest at 100 .
the Extra Class OVA also ranked once at 66 .
the DVD of the voice actor &apos;s live performance , come ! come ! well-come Party , ranked once at 177 on Oricon charts .
although generally well-received , the manga has also attracted some criticism .
Eduardo M.
Chavez , of Mania .
com , recalls being initially put off by the title , which for him conjured images of battles more physical than emotional .
after glancing through the first volume , he was surprised to find his assumption wrong , and concluded that it was appropriately named .
while he gives a largely positive review , Chavez finds the series &apos; artwork &quot; simple &quot; and unimpressive .
he notes that the first volume becomes slightly repetitive , so praises the way that Kobayashi introduces new themes to the second , bringing variety to the setting .
remarking on Kobayashi &apos;s ability to draw on numerous influences , Chavez applauds the manga artist for finding fresh ways of using old themes , preventing School Rumble from becoming derivative .
he reserves his highest praise for the &quot; flat &quot; chapters dealing with Yakumo .
in the next two volumes Chavez approves of the mixture of comedy and romance and the way the characters &quot; grow up &quot; , although acknowledging that while the manga &apos;s style suits his personal preferences it will not be to everyone &apos;s taste .
Sakura Eries , also of Mania .
com , gave volumes five , six , and eight to eleven positive ratings overall .
she noted that volume five may appeal to readers more interested in the side characters , and that appreciating Kobayashi &apos;s humor in the second half of chapter eight &quot; requires a bit more mental effort &quot; .
in volume ten , she remarks that while Kobayashi borrows the oft-used cliché of a disastrous school play , he manages to add enough twists to make it unique .
the play &apos;s climax , however , confused her more than it amused her .
Carlo Santos , of Anime News Network , gave the English releases of volumes two , three , four , and seven mixed — but largely favorable — B-range reviews .
volume nine he awards a C rating .
he approved of the character of Harima , particularly enjoying jokes comparing him to St.
Francis of Assisi .
Santos found the bonus chapters in volumes three and four , that deal with Yakumo , touching .
on the other hand , he criticizes various aspects of the artwork and , by volume seven , laments the staleness of recycled jokes .
despite volume nine &apos;s strong start , by its end he relates that , although there were some funny moments , he had become weary of its repetitive plot .
a fellow reviewer from Anime News Network , Carl Kimlinger , decided after reviewing four volumes that while the early volumes do not assist plot development , neither do they detract from the manga &apos;s appeal ; he too had a positive impression overall .
Kimlinger found the later volumes better and more entertaining , although not always during the romantic moments .
Chavez praised Del Rey &apos;s translation for retaining the manga &apos;s original identity ; the header , bumper artwork , character biographies , and front covers are all but identical to the Japanese .
Eries also thanked Del Rey &apos;s translation notes for clearing up some misconceptions for her , although she later concluded that their quality has deteriorated as the series progresses .
like the manga , the anime has been well received but does not avoid criticism ; in particular the quality of the animation for both seasons , including the OVAs , has attracted mixed reviews .
some of the humor and romantic elements have been derided while the English dubbing and soundtrack have been universally praised .
most reviewers took the position that , even if they dislike certain elements , the series as a whole contains something that makes them want to see more ; a view summed up by Chris Beveridge of Mania .
com , who writes : .
Beveridge cautioned that because the anime was designed around the non-linear format of the manga , its transitions might at first be troublesome for the viewer , but by the final volume finds the anime in all its aspects far superior .
while School Rumble is generally recognised as a shōnen title targeting the young male market , Katherine Luther , staff reviewer for About .
com , refers to it as a shōjo title aimed at girls and young women .
Lisa Marie , reviewer for RightStuf &apos;s Anime Today podcast , agrees that others , notably males , might see the series as shōjo .
Luther calls the first DVD &quot; the perfect back-to-school accessory &quot; , while Marie characterizes School Rumble as &quot; insane &quot; , asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like Excel Saga and Haré + Guu .
however , it uses its &quot; cast to break &#91; .
&#93; every rule of reality , but it plays everything so straight &#91; that &#93; it takes you a moment to realize what just happened doesn &apos;t make any sense .
&quot; a fan of the subgenre , she praises the anime it for its surreal humour , and for being &quot; anime newbie friendly &quot; in that its jokes work on multiple levels .
not all are of Japanese origin — such as a reference to the long triangular resolution of Star Wars &apos; Return of the Jedi — giving the series broad appeal .
anime News Network &apos;s reviewers found much to enjoy about the first series , although Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be &quot; watched in small doses , as trying to tackle too much of it in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells &quot; .
Carl Kimlinger comments that &quot; from the moment the words &apos; School Rumble &apos; come spinning onto the screen , you know you &apos;re in for .
undiluted good times &quot; , and that the title is &quot; two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you &apos;re likely to see anytime soon &quot; .
Carlo Santos praises volume six &apos;s bizarre comedy , but laments its romantic elements as being too generic .
overall , his rating is mediocre , saying that &quot; although this disc technically marks the end of &#91; the first season of &#93; School Rumble , it &apos;s really more of a pause , seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish &quot; .
reviewers from Mania .
com followed this pattern ; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series &apos; long-term entertainment value , but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder , found his early indifference fading as the story develops .
IGN &apos;s Jeff Harris , N.
Davidson , and David F.
Smith gave mostly positive reviews , although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five .
Jakub Lhota of Reanimated rated the first season an 8 / 10 , stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched , and the style — if not always the color — of Funimation &apos;s metallic locker artbox for School Rumble &apos;s English translation of the first season was welcomed .
according to Theron Martin , the OVA series School Rumble : extra Class was made mostly for devoted fans ; claiming that familiarity with the series is almost a necessity before watching it , although he later came to the view that it may also be useful as a sampler of the series .
Chris Beveridge gives the OVA series an overall negative review .
he did not highlight a single specific reason , instead observing that although all elements that &quot; make the TV series enjoyable are certainly present here , they just feel weaker &quot; .
however , it did make him want to watch more of the television series , thus serving its intended purpose in keeping interest in the series alive .
Katherine Luther endorsed the view that viewers need to be familiar with the story , but reviewed the OVA positively .
while she noted lulls in the action , she believes fans will be able to overlook this .
unlike Martin , Luther did not believe the OVA is a good introduction to School Rumble , due to its short sequences and seemingly random nature .
Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network declined to post commentary on the preview announcement for the second season , claiming &quot; we assume if you loved School Rumble , you &apos;re gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says , so why bother reviewing it ? &quot; David F.
Smith from IGN gave the first part of season two a rating of 6 / 10 , with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story .
specifically , Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously , and the studio for not cutting its budget for sight gags — something he notes that other companies do .
Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive , and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality .
she complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle .
Chris Beveridge claimed that , although it comes across well , the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting .
he was more critical of Funimation &apos;s packaging , preferring the first season &apos;s metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets .

Scoppito is a comune and town in the province of L &apos;Aquila , within the central Italy &apos;s region of Abruzzo .
year 393 ( CCCXCIII ) was a common year starting on Saturday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar .
at the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Augustus ( or , less frequently , year 1146 Ab urbe condita ) .
the denomination 393 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .
scorpion I was the first of two rulers of Upper Egypt during Naqada III .
scorpion is believed to have lived in Thinis one or two centuries before the rule of the better-known Scorpion II of Nekhen and is presumably the first true king of Upper Egypt .
to him belongs the U-j tomb found in the royal cemetery of Abydos where Thinite kings were buried .
that tomb was plundered in antiquity , but in it were found many small ivory plaques , each with a hole for tying it to something , and each marked with one or more hieroglyph-type scratched images which are thought to be names of towns , perhaps to tie the offerings and tributes to keep track of which came from which town .
two of those plaques seem to name the towns Baset and Buto , showing that Scorpion &apos;s armies had penetrated the Nile Delta .
it may be that the conquests of Scorpion started the Egyptian hieroglyphic system by starting a need to keep records in writing .
recently a 5,000-year-old graffito has been discovered in the Theban Desert Road Survey that also bears the symbols of Scorpion and depicts his victory over another protodynastic ruler ( possibly Naqada &apos;s king ) .
the defeated king or place named in the graffito was &quot; Bull &apos;s Head &quot; , a marking also found in U-j .

the Sigma baryons are a family of subatomic hadron particles which have a + 2 , + 1 or − 1 elementary charge or are neutral .
they are baryons containing three quarks : two up and / or down quarks , and one third quark , which can be either a strange ( symbols Σ + , Σ0 , Σ − ) , a charm ( symbols Σ + + c , Σ + c , Σ0 c ) , a bottom ( symbols Σ + b , Σ0 b , Σ − b ) or a top ( symbols Σ + + t , Σ + t , Σ0 t ) quark .
however , the top Sigmas are not expected to be observed as the Standard Model predicts the mean lifetime of top quarks to be roughly 6975500000000000000 ♠ 5 × 10 − 25 s .
this is about 20 times shorter than the timescale for strong interactions , and therefore it does not form hadrons .
the symbols encountered in these lists are : I ( isospin ) , J ( total angular momentum ) , P ( parity ) , u ( up quark ) , d ( down quark ) , s ( strange quark ) , c ( charm quark ) , t ( top quark ) , b ( bottom quark ) , Q ( charge ) , S ( strangeness ) , C ( charmness ) , B ′ ( bottomness ) , T ( topness ) , as well as other subatomic particles ( hover for name ) .
I , J , and P values in red have not been firmly established by experiments , but are predicted by the quark model and are consistent with the measurements .

societal psychology is a development within social psychology which emphasizes the all-embracing force of the social , institutional , and cultural environments , and with it the study of social phenomena in their own right as they affect , and are affected by , the members of the particular society .
the term societal psychology was coined by Hilde Himmelweit and George Gaskell in 1990 , in preference to sociological social psychology , to avoid a single alliance to one other discipline .
societal psychology is proffered as a counterweight to mainstream social psychology &apos;s concentration on the study of the individual &apos;s thoughts , feelings and actions , while paying little attention to the study of the environment , its culture and its institutions .
scholars in the field use the whole range of qualitative and quantitative social science methods and attempt to triangulate and validate their findings by different methods .
the choice and actual sequence of methods used depends on the particular problem addressed .
a number of theories are held to be particularly relevant to the development of societal psychology , such as Henri Tajfel &apos;s theories of social identity and intergroup relations , and Serge Moscovici &apos;s theories of social change and minority influence , the theory of social representations , as well as some approaches and methods from media studies , and discourse analysis , among others .
societal psychology is characterised by fifteen key propositions : .

skull Man ( Japanese : スカルマン , Hepburn : Sukaru Man ? ) is a shōnen manga series created by Shotaro Ishinomori which first appeared in Weekly Shōnen Magazine in 1970 and immediately caused a sensation .
this darkness was what made the Skull Man so magnetic and successful .
while developing the Kamen Rider ( Masked Rider ) TV series along with producer Toru Hirayama , Ishinomori created this manga as his own personal version , which the producers at Toei Company Ltd .
&#91; which ? &#93; they made several changes to the content , as Ishinomori &apos;s original 100-page one-shot story was too dark and gruesome ( even cerebral ) for a children &apos;s show .
the original 1970 version was digitally released in English by Ishimori productions in 2012 .
an animated TV series adaptation , produced by Bones and directed by Takeshi Mori , was broadcast on Fuji TV from April 28 , 2007 to July 22 , 2007 .
there are mass murders and catastrophes all over Japan , committed by a masked / caped psychic madman called the Skull Man , and his shape-shifting aide Garo ( named after the manga ninja Garo created by Sanpei Shirato ) , who can turn into various powerful mutant monsters .
the calamities caused by the Skull Man are investigated by the Tachiki Detective Agency , with the help of a young man named Tatsuo Kagura , the son of a yakuza in the Kagura Clan .
police Chief Tachiki , who heads the Tachiki Detective Agency , suspects that Tatsuo is the Skull Man .
Tatsuo , in turn , suspects that the detective is a part of a public conspiracy that has been after him for fifteen years .
it turns out that Tatsuo &apos;s parents were murdered and he was adopted by the Kagura Clan .
for fifteen years , Tatsuo has been hunting for the mastermind , who manipulates all industry , finance and even politics .
Tatsuo , the Skull Man , threateningly demands of Tachiki that he tell him the name of the mastermind .
after muttering the culprit &apos;s family name , Chisato , the Skull Man shoots him in the head .
skull Man and Garo then race to the estate of a reclusive old man named Kogetsu Chisato , who lives with a girl named Maya , who is mute and blind ( she is always seen with her eyes closed ) .
overcome with psychotic rage , Skull Man threatens to kill Chisato , who not only kindly welcomes him , but has been looking forward to his arrival .
Maya , however , telepathically persuades him not to kill Chisato , and reveals a shocking secret : Chisato is Skull Man &apos;s grandfather and Maya his younger sister .
Chisato tells his shocked grandson the whole story : his own son , Tatsuo &apos;s father , was a scientific genius beyond geniuses .
in fact , he was so intelligent and unearthly that he was a mutant , a being of Newmanity ( Shinjinrui - similar to that in Ishinomori &apos;s later creation , Inazuman ) .
his wife , whom he married and had Tatsuo with , was a mutant as well .
the couple conducted bizarre experiments that were capable of destroying humanity .
Chisato feared this greatly , so , when Maya was born , he killed his own son and daughter-in-law , and sought to kill his grandson Tatsuo , who ended up being rescued and raised by Garo .
he could not bring himself to kill Maya , however , and raised her to be his faithful servant .
Maya then tells Skull Man that Chisato wanted to bring him back before he could do anything .
Chisato traps himself , Skull Man , Garo and Maya in glass walls , and sets himself and all the others ablaze , sadly stating that &quot; We were born in the wrong era ! &quot; .
along with his entire &quot; family &quot; , Tatsuo dies a tragic , horrible death in the inferno .
the 1998 manga is a remake of the original manga .
skull Man revolves around Tatsuo Kagura , who early in his life was subjected to several mutating science experiments that ended up giving him amazing powers and skills .
the story begins abruptly with a woman who possesses immense psychic powers killing a man , only to then be attacked herself by a man who can become a bat , a wolf or an alligator named Garo .
Garo is revealed to be Skull Man ’ s childhood protector and present ally in the war against Rasputin and his hordes of evil mutants .
skull Man makes allies , loses comrades and dies in combat with a lethal mutant as in the first book .
what follows is a trip into the world of shadows and the evil within all of us .
while based on Ishinomori &apos;s original manga story , the 1990s version was put together by well-known manga artist Kazuhiko Shimamoto , who had been a fan of Ishinomori &apos;s work since childhood .
Ishinomori contacted Shimamoto towards the end of the former &apos;s life , requesting him to work with him on reviving the story of The Skull Man .

storge ( / ˈstɔːrɡiː / ; στοργή , storgē , store-gae ) , also called familial love , is the Greek word for natural affection , such as the love of a parent towards offspring and vice versa .
in social psychology , another term for love between good friends is philia .
storge or affection is a wide-ranging force which can apply between family members , friends , pets and owners , companions or colleagues ; it can also blend with and help underpin other types of tie such as passionate love or friendship .
thus storge may be used as a general term to describe the love between exceptional friends , and the desire for them to care compassionately for one another .
some &#91; who ? &#93; may say there are other ways to love one in storge form .
but this is between married couples , who are committed , and plan to have a long relationship together , particularly as a fundamental relational foundation post-limerance .
children and marriage are seen as legitimate longterm aims for their bond , while passionate sexual intensity is of lesser importance than in other love styles .
advantages of storgic love may be the level of how one loves their family and understands each other .
in addition , two people that are deeply devoted to one another can feel the intimacy that they share .
disadvantages The main disadvantage of storgic love may be the large time investment and fallout if the two people change enough to lose their friendship .

Sukarno was the leader of his country &apos;s struggle for Independence from the Netherlands .
he was a prominent leader of Indonesia &apos;s nationalist movement during the Dutch colonial period , and spent over a decade under Dutch detention until released by the invading Japanese forces .
Sukarno and his fellow nationalists collaborated to garner support for the Japanese war effort from the population , in exchange for Japanese aid in spreading nationalist ideas .
upon Japanese surrender , Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945 , and Sukarno was appointed as first president .
he led Indonesians in resisting Dutch re-colonization efforts via diplomatic and military means until the Dutch acknowledgment of Indonesian independence in 1949 .
author Pramoedya Ananta Toer once wrote &quot; Sukarno was the only Asian leader of the modern era able to unify people of such differing ethnic , cultural and religious backgrounds without shedding a drop of blood .
after a chaotic period of parliamentary democracy , Sukarno established an autocratic system called &quot; Guided Democracy &quot; in 1957 that successfully ended the instability and rebellions which were threatening the survival of the diverse and fractious country .
the early 1960s saw Sukarno veering Indonesia to the left by providing support and protection to the Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) at the expense of the military and Islamists .
he also embarked on a series of aggressive foreign policies under the rubric of anti-imperialism , with aid from the Soviet Union and China .
the 30 September Movement ( 1965 ) led to the destruction of the PKI and his replacement in 1967 by one of his generals , Suharto ( see Transition to the New Order ) , and he remained under house arrest until his death .
the spelling Soekarno , based on Dutch orthography , is still frequently used , mainly because he signed his name in the old spelling .
Sukarno himself insisted on a &quot; u &quot; , not &quot; oe &quot; , but said that he had been told in school to use the Dutch style .
he said that it was too difficult to change his signature , so still wrote it with an &quot; oe &quot; .
official Indonesian presidential decrees from the period 1947 – 1968 , however , printed his name using the 1947 spelling .
the Soekarno – Hatta International Airport which serves near Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia , still uses the Dutch spelling .
Indonesians also remember him as Bung Karno ( Brother / Comrade Karno ) or Pak Karno ( &quot; Mr.
like many Javanese people , he had only one name .
according to author Pramoedya Ananta Toer in several interviews , &quot; bung &quot; is an affectionate title meaning &quot; friend &quot; creatively used to be an alternative way of addressing person in equal manner , as an opposite word of old-form &quot; tuan &quot; , &quot; mas &quot; or &quot; bang &quot; .
he is sometimes referred to in foreign accounts as &quot; Achmad Sukarno &quot; , or some variation thereof .
the ( entirely fictitious ) first name was reputedly added by a British journalist , who felt his readers would be confused over someone with just a single name .
the son of a Javanese primary school teacher , an aristocrat named Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo , and his Balinese wife from the Brahman caste named Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai from Buleleng regency , Sukarno was born at Jalan Pandean IV / 40 Soerabaia ( now known as Surabaya ) , East Java , in the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) .
he was originally named KusnoJavanese pronunciation : &#91; kʊsnɔ &#93; .
following Javanese custom , he was renamed after surviving a childhood illness .
after graduating from a native primary school in 1912 , he was sent to the Europeesche Lagere School ( a Dutch primary school ) in Mojokerto .
in 1920 , Sukarno married Tjokroaminoto &apos;s daughter Siti Oetari .
during his study in Bandung , Sukarno became romantically involved with Inggit Garnasih , the wife of Sanoesi , the owner of the boarding house where he lived as a student .
Inggit was 13 years older than Sukarno .
in March 1923 , Sukarno divorced Siti Oetari to marry Inggit ( who also divorced her husband Sanoesi ) .
Sukarno later divorced Inggit and married Fatmawati .
among Sukarno &apos;s architectural works are the renovated building of the Preanger Hotel ( 1929 ) , where he acted as assistant to famous Dutch architect Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker .
Sukarno also designed many private houses on today &apos;s Jalan Gatot Subroto , Jalan Palasari , and Jalan Dewi Sartika in Bandung .
later on , as president , Sukarno remained engaged in architecture , designing the Proclamation Monument and adjacent Gedung Pola in Jakarta ; the Youth Monument ( Tugu Muda ) in Semarang ; the Alun-alun Monument in Malang ; the Heroes &apos; Monument in Surabaya ; and also the new city of Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan .
atypically , even among the country &apos;s small educated elite , Sukarno was fluent in several languages .
in addition to the Javanese language of his childhood , he was a master of Sundanese , Balinese and of Indonesian , and was especially strong in Dutch .
he was also quite comfortable in German , English , French , Arabic , and Japanese , all of which were taught at his HBS .
he was helped by his photographic memory and precocious mind .
in his studies , Sukarno was &quot; intensely modern , &quot; both in architecture and in politics .
he despised both the traditional Javanese feudalism , which he considered &quot; backward &quot; and to blame for the fall of the country under Dutch occupation and exploitation , and the imperialism practiced by Western countries , which he termed as &quot; exploitation of humans by other humans &quot; ( exploitation de l &apos;homme par l &apos;homme ) .
he he blamed this for the deep poverty and low levels of education of Indonesian people under the Dutch .
to promote nationalistic pride amongst Indonesians , Sukarno interpreted these ideas in his dress , in his urban planning for the capital ( eventually Jakarta ) , and in his socialist politics , though he did not extend his taste for modern art to pop music ; he had Koes Bersaudara imprisoned for their allegedly decadent lyrics despite his own reputation for womanising .
for Sukarno , modernity was blind to race , neat and elegant in style , and anti-imperialist .
Sukarno was first exposed to nationalist ideas while living under Tjokroaminoto .
later , while a student in Bandung , he immersed himself in European , American , Nationalist , communist , and religious political philosophy , eventually developing his own political ideology of Indonesian-style socialist self-sufficiency .
he began styling his ideas as Marhaenism , named after Marhaen , an Indonesian peasant he met in southern Bandung area , who owned his little plot of land and worked on it himself , producing sufficient income to support his family .
in university , Sukarno began organising a study club for Indonesian students , the Algemeene Studieclub , in opposition to the established student clubs dominated by Dutch students .
on 4 July 1927 , Sukarno with his friends from the Algemeene Studieclub established a pro-independence party , Partai Nasional Indonesia ( PNI ) , of which Sukarno was elected the first leader .
the party advocated independence for Indonesia , and opposed imperialism and capitalism because it opined that both systems worsened the life of Indonesian people .
the party also advocated secularism and unity amongst the many different ethnicities in the Dutch East Indies , to establish a united Indonesia .
Sukarno also hoped that Japan would commence a war against the western powers and that Java could then gain its independence with Japan &apos;s aid .
coming soon after the disintegration of Sarekat Islam in the early 1920s and the crushing of Partai Komunis Indonesia after their failed rebellion of 1926 , PNI began to attract a large number of followers , particularly among the new university-educated youths eager for larger freedoms and opportunities denied to them in the racist and constrictive political system of Dutch colonialism .
PNI activities came to the attention of the colonial government , and Sukarno &apos;s speeches and meetings were often infiltrated and disrupted by agents of the colonial secret police ( Politieke Inlichtingen Dienst / PID ) .
eventually , Sukarno and other key PNI leaders were arrested on 29 December 1929 by Dutch colonial authorities in a series of raids throughout Java .
Sukarno himself was arrested while on a visit to Yogyakarta .
during his trial at the Bandung Landraad courthouse from August to December 1930 , Sukarno made a series of long political speeches attacking colonialism and imperialism , titled Indonesia Menggoegat ( Indonesia Accuses ) .
in December 1930 , Sukarno was sentenced to four years in prison , which were served in Sukamiskin prison in Bandung .
his speech , however , received wide coverage by the press , and due to strong pressure from the liberal elements in both Netherlands and Dutch East Indies , Sukarno was released early on 31 December 1931 .
by this time , he had become a popular hero widely known throughout Indonesia .
however , during his imprisonment , PNI had been splintered by oppression of colonial authorities and internal dissension .
the original PNI was disbanded by the Dutch , and its former members formed two different parties ; the Partai Indonesia ( Partindo ) under Sukarno &apos;s associate Sartono who were promoting mass agitation , and the Pendidikan Nasional Indonesia ( PNI Baroe ) under Mohammad Hatta and Soetan Sjahrir , two nationalists who recently returned from studies in the Netherlands , and who were promoting a long-term strategy of providing modern education to the uneducated Indonesian populace to develop an intellectual elite able to offer effective resistance to Dutch rule .
after attempting to reconcile the two parties to establish one united nationalist front , Sukarno chose to become the head of Partindo on 28 July 1932 .
Partindo had maintained its alignment with Sukarno &apos;s own strategy of immediate mass agitation , and Sukarno disagreed with Hatta &apos;s long-term cadre-based struggle .
Hatta himself believed Indonesian independence would not occur within his lifetime , while Sukarno believed Hatta &apos;s strategy ignored of the fact that politics can only make real changes through formation and utilisation of force ( machtsvorming en machtsaanwending ) .
during this period , to support himself and the party financially , Sukarno returned to architecture , opening the bureau of Soekarno &amp; Rooseno .
he also wrote articles for the party &apos;s newspaper , Fikiran Ra &apos;jat .
while based in Bandung , Sukarno travelled extensively throughout Java to establish contacts with other nationalists .
his activities attracted further attention by the Dutch PID .
in mid-1933 , Sukarno published a series of writings titled Mentjapai Indonesia Merdeka ( &quot; To Attain Independent Indonesia &quot; ) .
for this writing , he was arrested by Dutch police while visiting fellow nationalist Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin in Jakarta on 1 August 1933 .
this time , to prevent providing Sukarno with a platform to make political speeches , the hardline governor-general Jonkheer Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge utilised his emergency powers to send Sukarno to internal exile without trial .
in 1934 , Sukarno was shipped , along with his family ( including Inggit Garnasih ) , to the remote town of Ende , on the island of Flores .
during his time in Flores , he utilised his limited freedom of movement to establish a children &apos;s theatre .
among its members was future politician Frans Seda .
due to an outbreak of malaria in Flores , the Dutch authorities decided to move Sukarno and his family to Bencoolen ( now Bengkulu ) on western coast of Sumatra , in February 1938 .
in Bengkulu , Sukarno became acquainted with Hassan Din , the local head of Muhammadiyah organisation , and he was allowed to teach religious teachings at a local school owned by the Muhammadiyah .
one of his students was 15-year-old Fatmawati , daughter of Hassan Din .
he became romantically involved with Fatmawati , which he justified by stating the inability of Inggit Garnasih to produce children during their almost 20-year marriage .
Sukarno was still in Bengkulu exile when the Japanese invaded the archipelago in 1942 .
in early 1929 , during the Indonesian National Revival , Sukarno and fellow Indonesian nationalist leader Mohammad Hatta ( later Vice President ) , first foresaw a Pacific War and the opportunity that a Japanese advance on Indonesia might present for the Indonesian independence cause .
in February 1942 Imperial Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies quickly defeating Dutch forces who marched , bussed and trucked Sukarno and his entourage three hundred kilometres from Bengkulu to Padang , Sumatra .
they intended keeping him prisoner and shipping him to Australia , but abruptly abandoned him to save themselves upon the impending approach of Japanese forces on Padang .
the Japanese had their own files on Sukarno and the Japanese commander in Sumatra approached him with respect , wanting to use him to organise and pacify the Indonesians .
Sukarno on the other hand wanted to use the Japanese to gain independence for Indonesia : &quot; the Lord be praised , God showed me the way ; in that valley of the Ngarai I said : Yes , Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon .
for the first time in all my life , I saw myself in the mirror of Asia .
&quot; in July 1942 , Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta , where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese , including Mohammad Hatta .
there , he met the Japanese commander General Hitoshi Imamura , who asked Sukarno and other nationalists to galvanise support from Indonesian populace to aid Japanese war effort .
Sukarno was willing to support the Japanese , in exchange for a platform for himself to spread nationalist ideas to the mass population .
the Japanese , on the other hand , needed Indonesia &apos;s manpower and natural resources to help its war effort .
the Japanese recruited millions of people , particularly from Java , to be forced labor called &quot; romusha &quot; in Japanese .
they were forced to build railways , airfields , and other facilities for the Japanese within Indonesia and as far away as Burma .
additionally , the Japanese requistioned rice and other food produced by Indonesian peasants to supply their own troops , while forcing the peasantry to cultivate castor oil plants to be used as aviation fuel and lubricants .
to gain cooperation from Indonesian population and to prevent resistance to these measures , the Japanese put Sukarno as head of Tiga-A mass organisation movement .
in March 1943 , the Japanese formed a new organisation called Poesat Tenaga Rakjat ( POETERA / Center of People &apos;s Power ) under Sukarno , Hatta , Ki Hadjar Dewantara , and KH Mas Mansjoer .
the aim of these organisations were to galvanise popular support for recruitment of romusha forced labor , requisitioning of food products , and to promote pro-Japanese and anti-Western sentiments amongst Indonesians .
Sukarno coined the term , Amerika kita setrika , Inggris kita linggis ( &quot; Let &apos;s iron America , and bludgeon the British &quot; ) to promote anti-Allied sentiments .
in later years , Sukarno was lastingly ashamed of his role with the romusha .
additionally , food requisitioning by the Japanese caused widespread famine in Java which killed more than one million people in 1944 – 1945 .
in his view , these were necessary sacrifices to be made to allow for future independence of Indonesia .
he also was involved with the formation of Pembela Tanah Air ( PETA ) and Heiho ( Indonesian volunteer army troops ) via speeches broadcast on the Japanese radio and loud speaker networks across Java and Sumatra .
by mid-1945 these units numbered around two million , and were preparing to defeat any Allied forces sent to re-take Java .
in the meantime , Sukarno eventually divorced Inggit , who refused to accept her husband &apos;s wish for polygamy .
she was provided with a house in Bandung and a pension for the rest of her life .
in 1943 , he married Fatmawati .
they lived in a house in Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No .
56 , confiscated from its previous Dutch owners and presented to Sukarno by the Japanese .
this house would later be the venue of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in 1945 .
on 10 November 1943 Sukarno and Hatta were sent on a seventeen-day tour of Japan , where they were decorated by the Emperor Hirohito and wined and dined in the house of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo in Tokyo .
on 7 September 1944 , with the war going badly for the Japanese , Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso promised independence for Indonesia , although no date was set .
on 29 April 1945 , with the fall of Philippines to American hands , the Japanese allowed for the establishment of Badan Penjelidik Oesaha-oesaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia ( BPUPKI ) , a quasi-legislature consisting of 67 representatives from most ethnic groups in Indonesia .
Sukarno was appointed as head of BPUPKI and was tasked to lead discussion to prepare the basis of a future Indonesian state .
to provide a common and acceptable platform to unite the various squabbling factions in BPUPKI , Sukarno formulated his ideological thinking developed for the past twenty years into five principles .
on 1 June 1945 , he introduced these five principles , known as pancasila , during the joint session of BPUPKI held in the former Volksraad Building ( now called Gedung Pancasila ) .
Pancasila as presented by Sukarno during the BPUPKI speech , consisted of five common principles which Sukarno saw as commonly shared by all Indonesians : .
due to pressure from the Islamic element , the first principle mentioned the obligation for Muslims to practice Islamic law ( sharia ) .
however , the final Sila as contained in the 1945 Constitution which was put into effect on 18 August 1945 , excluded the reference to Islamic law for sake of national unity .
the elimination of sharia was done by Mohammad Hatta based upon request by Christian representative Alexander Andries Maramis , and after consultation with moderate Islamic representatives Teuku Mohammad Hassan , Kasman Singodimedjo , and Ki Bagoes Hadikoesoemo .
on 7 August 1945 , the Japanese allowed the formation of a smaller Panitia Penjelidik Kemerdekaan Indonesia ( PPKI ) , a 21-person committee tasked with creating specific governmental structure of future Indonesian state .
on 9 August , the top leaders of PPKI ( Sukarno , Hatta , and KRT Radjiman Wediodiningrat ) , were summoned by Commander-in-Chief of Japan &apos;s Southern Expeditionary Forces , Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi , to Da Lat , 100 km from Saigon .
field Marshal Terauchi gave Sukarno the freedom to proceed with preparation for Indonesian independence , free of Japanese interference .
after much wining and dining , Sukarno &apos;s entourage was flown back to Jakarta on 14 August .
unbeknownst to the guests , atomic bombs had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and the Japanese were preparing for surrender .
the following day , on 15 August , the Japanese declared their acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration terms , and unconditionally surrendered to the Allies .
on the afternoon of that day , Sukarno received this information from leaders of youth groups and members of PETA Chairul Saleh , Soekarni , and Wikana , who had been listening to Western radio broadcasts .
they urged Sukarno to declare Indonesian independence immediately , while the Japanese were in confusion and before the arrival of Allied forces .
faced with this quick turn of events , Sukarno procrastinated .
he feared bloodbath due to hostile response from the Japanese to such a move , and was concerned with prospects of future Allied retribution .
at early morning on 16 August , the three youth leaders , impatient with Sukarno &apos;s indecision , kidnapped him from his house and brought him to a small house in Rengasdengklok , Karawang , owned by a Chinese family and occupied by PETA .
there they gained Sukarno &apos;s commitment to declare independence the next day .
that night , the youths drove Sukarno back to the house of Admiral Tadashi Maeda , the Japanese naval liaison officer in the Menteng area of Jakarta , who sympathised with Indonesian independence .
there , he and his assistant Sajoeti Melik prepared the text of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence .
in the early morning of 17 August 1945 , Sukarno returned to his house at Jl Pegangsaan Timur No .
56 , where he was joined by Mohammad Hatta .
throughout the morning , impromptu leaflets printed by PETA and youth elements informed the population of the impending proclamation .
finally , at 10 am , Sukarno and Hatta stepped to the front porch , where Sukarno declared the independence of the Republic of Indonesia in front of a crowd of 500 people .
this most historic of buildings had , however , been ordered to be demolished by Sukarno himself , without any apparent reason .
Sukarno &apos;s vision for the 1945 Indonesian constitution comprised the Pancasila ( five principles ) .
Sukarno &apos;s political philosophy was mainly a fusion of elements of Marxism , nationalism and Islam .
this is reflected in a proposition of his version of Pancasila he proposed to the BPUPKI ( Inspectorate of Indonesian Independence Preparation Efforts ) in a speech on 1 June 1945 .
Sukarno argued that all of the principles of the nation could be summarized in the phrase gotong royong .
the Indonesian parliament , founded on the basis of this original ( and subsequently revised ) constitution , proved all but ungovernable .
this was due to irreconcilable differences between various social , political , religious and ethnic factions .
in the days following the Proclamation , the news of Indonesian independence was spread by radio , newspaper , leaflets , and word of mouth despite attempts by the Japanese soldiers to suppress the news .
on 19 September , Sukarno addressed a crowd of one million people at the Ikada Field of Jakarta ( now part of Merdeka Square ) to commemorate one month of independence , indicating the strong level of popular support for the new republic , at least on Java and Sumatra .
in these two islands , the Sukarno government quickly established governmental control while the remaining Japanese mostly retreated to their barracks awaiting arrival of Allied forces .
this period was marked by constant attacks by armed groups on Europeans , Chinese , Christians , native aristocracy and anyone who were perceived to oppose Indonesian independence .
the most serious cases were the Social Revolutions in Aceh and North Sumatra , where large numbers of Acehnese and Malay aristocrats were killed by Islamic groups ( in Aceh ) and communist-led mobs ( in North Sumatra ) , and the &quot; Three Regions Affair &quot; in northwestern coast of Central Java where large numbers of Europeans , Chinese , and native aristocrats were butchered by mobs .
these bloody incidences continued until late 1945 to early 1946 , and begin to peter-out as Republican authorities begin to exert and consolidate control .
Sukarno &apos;s government initially postponed the formation of a national army , for fear of antagonizing the Allied occupation forces and their doubt over whether they would have been able to form an adequate military apparatus to maintain control of seized territory .
the members of various militia groups formed during Japanese occupation such as the disbanded PETA and Heiho , at that time were encouraged to join the BKR — Badan Keamanan Rakjat ( The People &apos;s Security Organization ) — itself a subordinate of the &quot; War Victims Assistance Organization &quot; .
it was only in October 1945 that the BKR was reformed into the TKR — Tentara Keamanan Rakjat ( The People &apos;s Security Army ) in response to the increasing Allied and Dutch presence in Indonesia .
the TKR armed themselves mostly by attacking Japanese troops and confiscating their weapons .
due to sudden transfer of Java and Sumatra from General Douglas MacArthur &apos;s American-dominated Southwest Pacific Area to Lord Louis Mountbatten &apos;s British-dominated Southeast Asian Command , the first Allied soldiers ( 1st Battalion of Seaforth Highlanders ) only arrived in Jakarta in late September 1945 .
British forces began to occupy major Indonesian cities in October 1945 .
the commander of British 23rd Division , Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison , set up command in the former governor-general &apos;s palace in Jakarta .
Christison stated its intentions as the liberation of all Allied prisoners-of-war , and to allow the return of Indonesia to its pre-war status , as colony of Netherlands .
the Republican government were willing to cooperate with regards to the release and repatriation of Allied civilian and military POWs , setting-up the Committee for the Repatriation of Japanese and Allied Prisoners of Wars and Internees ( Panitia Oeroesan Pengangkoetan Djepang dan APWI / POPDA ) for this purpose .
POPDA , in cooperation with the British , repatriated more than 70,000 Japanese and Allied POWs and internees by the end of 1946 .
to resist Dutch attempts to regain control of the country , Sukarno &apos;s strategy was to seek international recognition and support for the new Indonesian Republic , in view of the relative military weakness of the Republic compared with British and Dutch military power .
Sukarno was aware that his history as a Japanese collaborator and his leadership in the Japanese-approved PUTERA during the Occupation may complicate relationship with the Western countries .
hence , to help acquire international recognition as well as to accommodate domestic demands for establishment of political parties , Sukarno allowed the formation of parliamentary system of government , whereby a prime minister controlled day-to-day affairs of the government , while Sukarno as president remained as figurehead .
the prime minister and his cabinet will be responsible to the Central Indonesian National Committee instead of the president .
on 14 November 1945 , Sukarno appointed Sutan Sjahrir as first prime minister ; he was a European-educated politician who was never involved with the Japanese occupation authorities .
ominously , Dutch soldiers and administrators under the name of Netherlands Indies Civil Administration ( NICA ) began to return under the protection of the British .
they were led by Hubertus Johannes van Mook , a pre-war Dutch colonial administrator who led the Dutch East Indies government-in-exile in Brisbane , Australia .
they armed released Dutch POWs , which began to engage in shooting rampages against Indonesian civilians and Republican police .
as a consequence , armed conflict soon erupted between the newly constituted Republican forces aided by a myriad of pro-independence mob groups , against the British and Dutch forces .
on 10 November , a full-scale battle broke out in Surabaya between the British Indian 49th Infantry Brigade and the indigenous Indonesian population , involving air and naval bombardments of the city by the British .
300 British soldiers were killed ( including their commander Brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby ) , while thousands of Indonesians died .
shootouts broke out with alarming regularity in Jakarta , including an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Sjahrir by Dutch gunmen .
to avoid this menace , Sukarno and majority of his government left for the safety of Yogyakarta on 4 January 1946 .
there , the Republican government received protection and full support from Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX .
Yogyakarta would remain as the Republic &apos;s capital until the end of the war in 1949 .
Sjahrir remained in Jakarta to conduct negotiations with the British .
the initial series of battles in late 1945 and early 1946 left the British in control of major port cities on Java and Sumatra .
during the Japanese occupation , the Outer Islands ( excluding Java and Sumatra ) was occupied by Japanese Navy ( Kaigun ) , which did not allow for political mobilisation in their areas on account of the small population base available for mobilisation , and the proximity of these areas to active theatres of war .
consequently , there were little Republican activity in these islands post-proclamation .
Australian and Dutch forces quickly occupied these islands without much fighting by end of 1945 ( excluding the resistance of I Gusti Ngurah Rai in Bali , the insurgency in South Sulawesi , and fighting in Hulu Sungai area of South Kalimantan ) .
meanwhile , the hinterland areas of Java and Sumatra remained under Republican administration .
eager to pull out its soldiers from Indonesia , the British allowed for large-scale infusion of Dutch forces into the country throughout 1946 .
by November 1946 , all British soldiers have been withdrawn from Indonesia , replaced by more than 150,000 Dutch soldiers .
on the other hand , the British sent Lord Archibald Clark Kerr , 1st Baron Inverchapel and Miles Lampson , 1st Baron Killearn to bring the Dutch and Indonesians to the negotiating table .
the result of these negotiations was the Linggadjati Agreement signed in November 1946 , where the Dutch acknowledged de facto Republican sovereignty over Java , Sumatra , and Madura .
in exchange , the Republicans were willing to discuss future Commonwealth-like United Kingdom of Netherlands and Indonesia .
Sukarno &apos;s decision to negotiate with the Dutch was met with strong opposition by various Indonesian factions .
Tan Malaka , a communist politician , organised these groups into a united front called the Persatoean Perdjoangan ( PP ) .
pp offered a &quot; Minimum Program &quot; which called for complete independence , nationalisation of all foreign properties , and rejection of all negotiations until all foreign troops are withdrawn .
these programmes received widespread popular support , including from armed forces commander General Sudirman .
on 4 July 1946 , military units linked with PP kidnapped Prime Minister Sjahrir who was visiting Yogyakarta .
Sjahrir was leading the negotiation with the Dutch .
Sukarno , after successfully influencing Sudirman , managed to secure the release of Sjahrir and the arrest of Tan Malaka and other PP leaders .
disapproval of Linggadjati terms within the KNIP led Sukarno to issue a decree doubling KNIP membership by including many pro-agreement appointed members .
as consequence , KNIP ratified the Linggadjati Agreement in March 1947 .
on 21 July 1947 , the Linggadjati Agreement was broken by the Dutch , who launched Operatie Product , a massive military invasion into Republican-held territories .
although the newly reconstituted TNI was unable to offer significant military resistance , the blatant violation by the Dutch of an internationally brokered agreement outraged world opinion .
international pressure forced the Dutch to halt their invasion force in August 1947 .
Sjahrir , who has been replaced as prime minister by Amir Sjarifuddin , flew to New York City to appeal Indonesian case in front of United Nations .
UN Security Council issued a resolution calling for immediate ceasefire , and appointed a Good Offices Committee ( GOC ) to oversee the ceasefire .
the GOC , based in Jakarta , consisted of delegations from Australia ( led by Richard Kirby , chosen by Indonesia ) , Belgium ( led by Paul van Zeeland , chosen by Netherlands ) , and United States ( led by Frank Porter Graham , neutral ) .
the Republic was now under strong Dutch military stranglehold , with the Dutch military occupying West Java , and the northern coast of Central Java and East Java , along with the key productive areas of Sumatra .
additionally , the Dutch navy blockaded Republican areas from supplies of vital food , medicine , and weapons .
as a consequence , Prime Minister Amir Sjarifuddin has little choice but to sign the Renville Agreement on 17 January 1948 , which acknowledged Dutch control over areas taken during Operatie Product , while the Republicans pledged to withdraw all forces that remained on the other side of the ceasefire line ( &quot; Van Mook Line &quot; ) .
meanwhile , the Dutch begin to organize puppet states in the areas under their occupation , to counter Republican influence utilising ethnic diversity of Indonesia .
the signing of highly disadvantageous Renville Agreement caused even greater instability within the Republican political structure .
in Dutch-occupied West Java , Darul Islam guerrillas under Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo maintained their anti-Dutch resistance and repealed any loyalty to the Republic ; they caused a bloody insurgency in West Java and other areas in the first decades of independence .
Prime Minister Sjarifuddin , who signed the agreement , was forced to resign in January 1948 , and was replaced by Mohammad Hatta .
Hatta cabinet &apos;s policy of rationalising the armed forces by demobilising large numbers of armed groups that proliferated the Republican areas , also caused severe disaffection .
leftist political elements , led by resurgent Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) under Musso took advantage of public disaffections by launching rebellion in Madiun , East Java , on 18 September 1948 .
bloody fighting continued during late-September until end of October 1948 , when the last communist bands were defeated and Musso shot dead .
the communists had overestimated their potential to oppose the strong appeal of Sukarno amongst the population .
on 19 December 1948 , to take advantage of the Republic &apos;s weak position following the communist rebellion , the Dutch launched Operatie Kraai , a second military invasion designed to crush the Republic once and for all .
the invasion was initiated with an airborne assault on Republican capital Yogyakarta .
Sukarno ordered the armed forces under Sudirman to launch guerilla campaign in the countryside , while he and other key leaders such as Hatta and Sjahrir allowed themselves to be taken prisoner by the Dutch .
to ensure continuity of government , Sukarno sent a telegram to Sjafruddin Prawiranegara , providing him the mandate to lead an Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia ( PDRI ) , based on the unoccupied hinterlands of West Sumatra , a position he kept until Sukarno was released in June 1949 .
the Dutch sent Sukarno and other captured Republican leaders to captivity in Prapat , in Dutch-occupied part of North Sumatra and later to the island of Bangka .
the second Dutch invasion caused even more international outrage .
the United States , impressed by Indonesia &apos;s ability to defeat the 1948 communist challenge without outside help , threatened to cut off Marshall Aid funds to the Netherlands if military operations in Indonesia continued .
TNI did not disintegrate and continued to wage guerilla resistance against the Dutch , most notably the assault on Dutch-held Yogyakarta led by Lieutenant-Colonel Suharto on 1 March 1949 .
consequently , the Dutch were forced to sign the Roem-van Roijen Agreement on 7 May 1949 .
according to this treaty , the Dutch released the Republican leadership and returned the area surrounding Yogyakarta to Republican control in June 1949 .
this was followed by the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference held in The Hague which led to the complete transfer of sovereignty by the Queen Juliana of the Netherlands to Indonesia , on 27 December 1949 .
on that day , Sukarno flew from Yogyakarta to Jakarta , making a triumphant speech at the steps of the governor-general &apos;s palace , immediately renamed the Merdeka Palace ( &quot; Independence Palace &quot; ) .
at this time , as part of a compromise with the Dutch , Indonesia adopted a new federal constitution that made the country a federal state called the Republik Indonesia Serikat ( Republic of United States of Indonesia ) , consisting of the Republic of Indonesia whose borders were determined by the &quot; Van Mook Line &quot; , along with the six states and nine autonomous territories created by the Dutch .
during the first half of 1950 , these states gradually dissolved themselves as the Dutch military that previously propped them up was withdrawn .
in August 1950 , with the last state – the State of East Indonesia – dissolving itself , Sukarno declared a Unitary Republic of Indonesia based on the newly formulated provisional constitution of 1950 .
both the Federal Constitution of 1949 and the Provisional Constitution of 1950 were parliamentary in nature , where executive authority laid with the prime minister , and which — on paper — limited presidential power .
however , even with his formally reduced role , he commanded a good deal of moral authority as Father of the Nation .
the first years of parliamentary democracy proved to be very unstable for Indonesia .
cabinets fell in rapid succession due to the acute differences between the various political parties within the newly appointed parliament ( Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat / DPR ) .
there was severe disagreements on future path of Indonesian state , between nationalists who wanted a secular state ( led by Partai Nasional Indonesia first established by Sukarno ) , the Islamists who wanted an Islamic state ( led by Masyumi Party ) , and the communists who wanted a communist state ( led by PKI , only allowed to operate again in 1951 ) .
on the economic front , there was severe dissatisfaction with continuing economic domination by large Dutch corporations and the ethnic-Chinese .
the Darul Islam rebels under Kartosuwirjo in West Java refused to acknowledge Sukarno &apos;s authority and declared a NII ( Negara Islam Indonesia – Islamic State of Indonesia ) in August 1949 .
rebellions in support of Darul Islam also broke out in South Sulawesi in 1951 , and in Aceh in 1953 .
meanwhile , pro-federalism members of the disbanded KNIL launched failed rebellion in Bandung ( APRA rebellion of 1950 ) , in Makassar in 1950 , and in Ambon ( Republic of South Maluku revolt of 1950 ) .
additionally , the military was torn by hostilities between officers originating from the colonial-era KNIL , who wished for a small and elite professional military , and the overwhelming majority of soldiers who started their careers in the Japanese-formed PETA , who were afraid of being discharged and were more known for nationalist-zeal over professionalism .
on 17 October 1952 , the leaders of the former-KNIL faction , Army Chief Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution and Armed Forces Chief-of-Staff Tahi Bonar Simatupang mobilized their troops in a show of force .
protesting against attempts by the DPR to interfere in military business on behalf of the former-PETA faction of the military , Nasution and Simatupang had their troops surround the Merdeka Palace and point their tank turrets at the building .
their demand to Sukarno was that the current DPR be dismissed .
for this cause , Nasution and Simatupang also mobilized civilian protesters .
Sukarno came out of the palace and convinced both the soldiers and the civilians to go home .
Nasution and Simatupang were later dismissed .
Nasution , however , would be re-appointed as Army Chief after reconciling with Sukarno in 1955 .
in 1954 , Sukarno married Hartini , a 30-year-old widow from Salatiga , whom he met during a reception .
his third wife , Fatmawati was outraged by this fourth marriage .
she left Sukarno and their children , although they never officially divorced .
Fatmawati no longer took up the duties as First Lady , a role subsequently filled by Hartini .
on the international front , Sukarno organized the Bandung Conference in 1955 , with the goal of uniting the developing Asian and African countries into a &quot; non-aligned movement &quot; to counter both the United States and the Soviet Union .
Sukarno came to resent his figurehead position and the increasing disorder of the country &apos;s political life .
claiming that Western-style parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Indonesia , he called for a system of &quot; guided democracy .
he proposed a government based not only on political parties but on &quot; functional groups &quot; composed of the nation &apos;s basic elements , which would together form a National Council , through which a national consensus could express itself under presidential guidance .
Vice-President Mohammad Hatta was strongly opposed to Sukarno &apos;s guided democracy concept .
citing this and other irreconcilable differences , Hatta resigned from his position in December 1956 .
Hatta &apos;s retirement sent a shockwave across Indonesia , particularly among the non-Javanese ethnicities , who viewed Hatta as their representative in a Javanese-dominated government .
from December 1956 to January 1957 , regional military commanders in North Sumatra , Central Sumatra , and South Sumatra provinces took over local government control .
they declared a series of military councils which were to run their respective areas and refused to accept orders from Jakarta .
a similar regional military movement took control of North Sulawesi in March 1957 .
they demanded the elimination of communist influence in government , equal share in government revenues , and reinstatement of the former Sukarno-Hatta duumvirate .
faced with this serious challenge to the unity of the republic , Sukarno declared martial law ( Staat van Oorlog en Beleg ) on 14 March 1957 .
he appointed a non-partisan prime minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja , while the military was in the hands of his loyal General Nasution .
Nasution increasingly shared Sukarno &apos;s views on the negative impact of western democracy on Indonesia , and he saw a greater role for the military in political life .
as a reconciliatory move , Sukarno invited the leaders of the regional councils to Jakarta on 10 – 14 September 1957 , to attend a National Conference ( Musjawarah Nasional ) , which failed to bring a solution to the crisis .
on 30 November 1957 , an assassination attempt was made on Sukarno by way of a grenade attack while he was visiting a school function in Cikini , Central Jakarta .
six children were killed , but Sukarno did not suffer any serious wounds .
the perpetrators were members of the Darul Islam group , under the order of its leader Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo .
by December 1957 , Sukarno began to take serious steps to enforce his authority over the country .
on that month , he nationalized 246 Dutch companies which had been dominating the Indonesian economy , most notably the NHM , Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij , Escomptobank , and the &quot; big five &quot; Dutch trading corporations ( NV Borneo Sumatra Maatschappij / Borsumij , NV Internationale Crediet- en Handelsvereeneging &quot; Rotterdam &quot; / Internatio , NV Jacobson van den Berg &amp; Co , NV Lindeteves-Stokvis , and NV Geo Wehry &amp; Co ) , and expelled 40,000 Dutch citizens remaining in Indonesia while confiscating their properties , purportedly due to the failure by the Dutch government to continue negotiations on the fate of Netherlands New Guinea as was promised in the 1949 Round Table Conference .
Sukarno &apos;s policy of economic nationalism was strengthened by the issuance Presidential Directive No .
10 of 1959 , which banned commercial activities by foreign nationals in rural areas .
this rule targeted ethnic Chinese , who dominated both the rural and urban retail economy despite the fact that at this time few of them had Indonesian citizenship .
this policy resulted in massive relocation of the rural ethnic-Chinese population to urban areas , and approximately 100,000 chose to return to China .
to face the dissident regional commanders , Sukarno and Army Chief Nasution decided to take drastic steps following the failure of Musjawarah Nasional .
by utilizing regional officers that remained loyal to Jakarta , Nasution organized a series of &quot; regional coups &quot; which ousted the dissident commanders in North Sumatra ( Colonel Maludin Simbolon ) and South Sumatra ( Colonel Barlian ) by December 1957 .
this returned government control over key cities of Medan and Palembang .
in February 1958 , the remaining dissident commanders in Central Sumatra ( Colonel Ahmad Hussein ) and North Sulawesi ( Colonel Ventje Sumual ) declared the PRRI-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Jakarta government .
they were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party , such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara who were opposed to growing influence of communists .
due to their anti-communist rhetoric , the rebels received money , weapons , and manpower from the CIA in a campaign known as Archipelago .
this support ended when Allen Lawrence Pope , an American pilot , was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958 .
in April 1958 , the central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions on Padang and Manado , the rebel capitals .
by the end of 1958 , the rebels had been militarily defeated , and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered in August 1961 .
the impressive military victories over the PRRI-Permesta rebels and the popular nationalisation of Dutch companies left Sukarno in a very strong position .
on 5 July 1959 , Sukarno reinstated the 1945 constitution by presidential decree .
it established a presidential system which he believed would make it easier to implement the principles of guided democracy .
he called the system Manifesto Politik or Manipol — but was actually government by decree .
Sukarno envisioned an Indonesian-style socialist society , adherent to the principle of USDEK : .
in March 1960 , Sukarno disbanded parliament and replaced it with a new parliament where half the members were appointed by the president ( Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat – Gotong Rojong / DPR-GR ) .
in September 1960 , he established a Provisional People &apos;s Consultative Assembly ( Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat Sementara / MPRS ) as the highest legislative authority according to the 1945 constitution .
MPRS members consisted of members of DPR-GR and members of &quot; functional groups &quot; appointed by the president .
with the backing of the military , Sukarno disbanded the Islamic party Masyumi and Sutan Sjahrir &apos;s party PSI , accusing them of involvement with PRRI-Permesta affair .
the military arrested and imprisoned many of Sukarno &apos;s political opponents , from socialist Sjahrir to Islamic politicians Mohammad Natsir and Hamka .
using martial law powers , the government closed-down newspapers who were critical of Sukarno &apos;s policies .
during this period , there were several assassination attempts on Sukarno &apos;s life .
on 9 March 1960 , Daniel Maukar , an Indonesian airforce lieutenant who sympathised with the Permesta rebellion , strafed the Merdeka Palace and Bogor Palace with his MiG-17 fighter jet , attempting to kill the president ; he was not injured .
in May 1962 , Darul Islam agents shot at the president during Eid al-Adha prayers on the grounds of the palace .
Sukarno again escaped injury .
on the security front , the military started a series of effective campaigns which ended the long-festering Darul Islam rebellion in West Java ( 1962 ) , Aceh ( 1962 ) , and South Sulawesi ( 1965 ) .
Kartosuwirjo , the leader of Darul Islam , was captured and executed in September 1962 .
to counterbalance the power of the military , Sukarno started to rely on the support of the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) .
in 1960 , he declared his government to be based on Nasakom , a union of the three ideological strands present in Indonesian society : nasionalisme ( nationalism ) , agama ( religions ) , and komunisme ( communism ) .
accordingly , Sukarno started admitting more communists into his government , while developing strong relationship with the PKI chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit .
in order to increase Indonesia &apos;s prestige , Sukarno supported and won the bid for the 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta .
many sporting facilities such as the Senayan sports complex ( including the 100,000-seat Bung Karno Stadium ) were built to accommodate the games .
there was political tension when the Indonesians refused the entry of delegations from Israel and Taiwan .
after the International Olympic Committee put sanctions on Indonesia due to this exclusion policy , Sukarno retaliated by organising a &quot; non-imperialist &quot; competitor event to the Olympic Games , called the Games of New Emerging Forces ( GANEFO ) .
GANEFO was successfully held in Jakarta in November 1963 , and was attended by 2,700 athletes from 51 countries .
as part of his prestige-building program , Sukarno ordered the construction of large monumental buildings such as National Monument ( Monumen Nasional ) , Istiqlal Mosque , Jakarta , CONEFO Building ( now the Parliament Building ) , Hotel Indonesia , and the Sarinah shopping centre to transform Jakarta from a former colonial backwater to a modern city .
the modern Jakarta boulevards of Jalan Thamrin , Jalan Sudirman , and Jalan Gatot Subroto was planned and constructed under Sukarno .
as Sukarno &apos;s domestic authority was secured , he began to pay more attention to the world stage .
he embarked on a series of aggressive and assertive policies based on anti-imperialism to increase Indonesia &apos;s international prestige .
these anti-imperialist and anti-Western policies , often employing brinkmanship with other nations , were also designed to unite the diverse and fractious Indonesian people .
in this , he was aided by his Foreign Minister Subandrio .
after his first visit to Beijing in 1956 , Sukarno began to strengthen his ties to the People &apos;s Republic of China and the communist bloc in general .
he also began to accept increasing amounts of Soviet bloc military aid .
by the early 1960s , the Soviet bloc provided more aid to Indonesia than to any other non-communist country , while Soviet military aid to Indonesia was equalled only by its aid to Cuba .
this large influx of communist aid prompted an increase in military aid from the Dwight Eisenhower and John F.
Kennedy Administrations , which worried about a leftward drift should Sukarno rely too much on Soviet bloc aid .
Sukarno was feted during his visit to the United States in 1956 , where he addressed a joint session of United States Congress .
soon after his first visit to America , Sukarno visited the Soviet Union , where he received an even more lavish welcome .
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev paid a return visit to Jakarta and Bali in 1960 , where he awarded Sukarno with the Lenin Peace Prize .
to make amends for CIA involvement in the PRRI-Permesta rebellion , US President Kennedy invited Sukarno to Washington , D.
and provided Indonesia with billions of dollars in civilian and military aid .
to follow up on the successful 1955 Bandung Conference , Sukarno attempted to forge a new alliance called the &quot; New Emerging Forces &quot; ( NEFO ) , as a counter to the Western superpowers dubbed the &quot; Old Established Forces &quot; ( OLDEFO ) , whom he accused of spreading &quot; Neo-Colonialism and Imperialism &quot; ( NEKOLIM ) .
in 1961 , Sukarno established another political alliance , called the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM , in Indonesia known as Gerakan Non-Blok , GNB ) with Egypt &apos;s President Gamal Abdel Nasser , India &apos;s Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , Yugoslavia &apos;s President Josip Broz Tito , and Ghana &apos;s President Kwame Nkrumah , in an action called The Initiative of Five ( Sukarno , Nkrumah , Nasser , Tito , and Nehru ) .
Nam was intended to provide political unity and influence for nations who wished to maintain independence from the American and Soviet superpower blocs , which were engaged in Cold War competition .
Sukarno is still fondly remembered for his role in promoting the influence of newly independent countries .
his name is used as a street name in Cairo , Egypt and Rabat , Morocco , and as a major square in Peshawar , Pakistan .
in 1956 , the University of Belgrade awarded him an honorary doctorate .
in 1960 Sukarno began an aggressive foreign policy to secure Indonesian territorial claims .
in August of that year , Sukarno broke off diplomatic relations with the Netherlands over the continuing failure to commence talks on the future of Netherlands New Guinea , as was agreed at the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949 .
in April 1961 the Dutch announced the formation of a Nieuw Guinea Raad , with the intention of creating an independent Papuan state .
Sukarno declared a state of military confrontation in his Tri Komando Rakjat ( TRIKORA ) speech in Yogyakarta , on 19 December 1961 .
he then directed military incursions into the half-island , which he referred to as West Irian .
by end of 1962 3,000 Indonesian soldiers were present throughout West Irian / West Papua .
a naval battle erupted in January 1962 when four Indonesian torpedo boats were intercepted by Dutch ships and planes off the coast of Vlakke Hoek .
one Indonesian boat was sunk , killing the Naval Deputy Chief-of-Staff Commodore Jos Sudarso .
meanwhile , the Kennedy Administration worried of a continuing Indonesian shift towards communism should the Dutch hold on to West Irian / West Papua .
in February 1962 US Attorney General Robert Kennedy travelled to the Netherlands and informed the government that the United States would not support the Netherlands in an armed conflict with Indonesia .
with Soviet armaments and advisors , Sukarno planned a large-scale air- and seaborne invasion of the Dutch military headquarters of Biak for August 1962 , called Operasi Djajawidjaja .
it was to be led by Major-General Suharto , the future President of Indonesia .
before these plans could be realised , Indonesia and Netherlands signed the New York Agreement in August 1962 .
the two countries agreed to implement the Bunker Plan ( formulated by American diplomat Ellsworth Bunker ) , whereby the Dutch agreed to hand over West Irian / West Papua to UNTEA on 1 October 1962 .
UNTEA transferred the territory to Indonesian authority in May 1963 .
after securing control over West Irian / West Papua , Sukarno then opposed the British-supported establishment of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 , claiming that it was a neo-colonial plot by the British to undermine Indonesia .
despite Sukarno &apos;s political overtures , which found some support when leftist political elements in British Borneo territories Sarawak and Brunei opposed the Federation plan and aligned themselves with Sukarno , Malaysia was established in September 1963 .
this was followed by the Indonesia – Malaysia confrontation ( Konfrontasi ) , proclaimed by Sukarno in his Dwi Komando Rakjat ( DWIKORA ) speech in Jakarta on 3 May 1964 .
Sukarno &apos;s proclaimed objective was not , as some alleged , to annex Sabah and Sarawak into Indonesia , but to establish a &quot; State of North Kalimantan &quot; under the control of North Kalimantan Communist Party .
from 1964 until early 1966 , a limited number of Indonesian soldiers , civilians , and Malaysian communist guerrillas were sent into North Borneo and the Malay Peninsula .
these forces fought with British and Commonwealth soldiers deployed to protect the nascent state of Malaysia .
Indonesian agents also exploded several bombs in Singapore .
domestically , Sukarno fomented anti-British sentiment and the British Embassy was burned down .
in 1964 , all British companies operating in the country , including Indonesian operations of the Chartered Bank and Unilever , were nationalized .
in 1964 Sukarno commenced an anti-American campaign , which was motivated by his shift towards the communist bloc and less friendly relations with the Lyndon Johnson Administration .
American interests and businesses in Indonesia were denounced by government officials and attacked by PKI-led mobs .
American movies were banned , American books and Beatles albums were burned , and the Indonesian band Koes Plus was jailed for playing American-style rock and roll music .
as a result , US aid to Indonesia was halted , to which Sukarno made his famous remark , &quot; Go to hell with your aid &quot; .
Sukarno withdrew Indonesia from the United Nations on 7 January 1965 when , with US backing , Malaysia took a seat on UN Security Council .
as the NAM countries were becoming split into different factions , and as fewer countries were willing to support his anti-Western foreign policies , Sukarno began to abandon his non-alignment rhetoric .
Sukarno formed a new alliance with China , North Korea , North Vietnam , and Cambodia which he called the &quot; Beijing-Pyongyang-Hanoi-Phnom Penh-Jakarta Axis &quot; .
after withdrawing Indonesia from the &quot; imperialist-dominated &quot; United Nations in January 1965 , Sukarno sought to establish a competitor organization to the UN called the Conference of New Emerging Forces ( CONEFO ) with support from China , who at that time was not yet a member of United Nations .
&#91; citation needed &#93; With the government heavily indebted to the Soviet Union , Indonesia became increasingly dependent on China for support .
Sukarno spoke increasingly of a Beijing-Jakarta axis , which would be the core of a new anti-imperialist world organization , the CONEFO .
&#91; citation needed &#93; .
domestically , Sukarno continued to consolidate his control .
he was made president for life by the MPRS in 1963 .
his ideological writings on Manipol-USDEK and NASAKOM became mandatory subjects in Indonesian schools and universities , while his speeches were to be memorized and discussed by all students .
all newspapers , the only radio station ( RRI ) , and the only television station ( TVRI ) were made into &quot; tools of the revolution &quot; and functioned to spread Sukarno &apos;s messages .
Sukarno developed a personality cult , with the capital of newly acquired West Irian renamed to Sukarnapura and the highest peak in the country was renamed from Carstensz Pyramid to Puntjak Sukarno ( Sukarno Peak ) .
despite these appearances of unchallenged control , Sukarno &apos;s guided democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars , the military and the communists .
the military , nationalists , and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno &apos;s protection .
they feared an imminent establishment of a communist state in Indonesia .
by 1965 , the PKI had 3 million members , and were particularly strong in Central Java and Bali .
PKI had become the strongest party in Indonesia .
the military and nationalists were growing wary of Sukarno &apos;s close alliance with communist China , which they thought compromised Indonesia &apos;s sovereignty .
elements of the military disagreed with Sukarno &apos;s policy of confrontation with Malaysia , which in their view only benefited communists , and sent several officers ( including future Armed Forces Chief Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani ) to spread secret peace-feelers to the Malaysian government .
the Islamic clerics , who were mostly landowners , felt threatened by PKI &apos;s land confiscation actions ( aksi sepihak ) in the countryside and by the communist campaign against the &quot; seven village devils &quot; , a term used for landlords or better-off farmers ( similar to the anti-kulak campaign in Stalinist era ) .
both groups harbored deep disdain for PKI in particular due to memories of the bloody 1948 communist rebellion .
as the mediator of the three groups under the NASAKOM system , Sukarno displayed greater sympathies to the communists .
the PKI had been very careful to support all of Sukarno &apos;s policies .
meanwhile , Sukarno saw the PKI as the best-organised and ideologically solid party in Indonesia , and a useful conduit to gain more military and financial aid from Communist Bloc countries .
Sukarno also sympathised with the communists &apos; revolutionary ideals , which were similar to his own .
to weaken the influence of the military , Sukarno rescinded martial law ( which gave wide-ranging powers to the military ) in 1963 .
in September 1962 , he &quot; promoted &quot; the powerful General Nasution to the less-influential position of Armed Forces Chief , while the influential position of Army Chief was given to Sukarno &apos;s loyalist Ahmad Yani .
meanwhile , the position of Air Force Chief was given to Omar Dhani , who was an open communist sympathiser .
in May 1964 , Sukarno banned activities of Manifesto Kebudajaan ( Manikebu ) , an association of artists and writers which included prominent Indonesian writers such as Hans Bague Jassin and Wiratmo Soekito , who were also dismissed from their jobs .
Manikebu was considered a rival by the communist writer &apos;s association Lembaga Kebudajaan Rakjat ( Lekra ) , led by Pramoedya Ananta Toer .
in December 1964 , Sukarno disbanded the Badan Pendukung Soekarnoisme ( BPS ) , the &quot; Association for Promoting Sukarnoism &quot; , an organisation that sought to oppose communism by invoking Sukarno &apos;s own Pancasila formulation .
in January 1965 , Sukarno , under pressure from PKI , banned the Murba Party .
Murba was a Trotskyite party whose ideology was antagonistic to PKI &apos;s orthodox line of Marxism .
tensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965 , when PKI chairman Aidit called for the formation of a &quot; fifth armed force &quot; consisting of armed peasants and labor .
Sukarno approved this idea and publicly called for the immediate formation of such a force on 17 May 1965 .
however , this idea was rejected by Army Chief Ahmad Yani and Defence Minister Nasution , as this was tantamount to allowing the PKI to establish its own armed forces .
soon after this rejection , on 29 May , the &quot; Gilchrist Letter &quot; appeared .
the letter was supposedly written by the British ambassador Andrew Gilchrist to the Foreign Office in London , mentioning a joint American and British attempt on subversion in Indonesia with the help of &quot; local army friends &quot; .
this letter , produced by Subandrio , aroused Sukarno &apos;s fear of a military plot to overthrow him , a fear which he mentioned repeatedly during the next few months .
the Czechoslovakian agent Ladislav Bittman who defected in 1968 claimed that his agency ( StB ) forged the letter on request from PKI via Soviet Union , to smear anti-communist generals .
on his independence day speech of 17 August 1965 , Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes , and warned the Army not to interfere .
he also stated his support for the establishment of &quot; fifth force &quot; of armed peasants and labor .
while Sukarno devoted his energy to domestic and international politics , the economy of Indonesia was neglected and deteriorated rapidly .
the government printed money to finance its military expenditures , resulting in hyperinflation exceeding 600 % per annum in 1964 – 1965 .
smuggling and collapse of export plantation sectors deprived the government of much-needed foreign exchange income .
consequently , the government was unable to service massive foreign debts it accumulated from both Western and Communist bloc countries .
most of the government budget was spent on the military , resulting in deterioration of infrastructure such as roads , railways , ports , and other public facilities .
deteriorating transportation infrastructure and poor harvests caused food shortages in many places .
the small industrial sector languished and only produced at 20 % capacity due to lack of investment .
Sukarno himself was contemptuous of macroeconomics , and was unable and unwilling to provide practical solutions to the poor economic condition of the country .
instead , Sukarno produced more ideological conceptions such as Trisakti : political sovereignty , economic self-sufficiency , and cultural independence .
he advocated Indonesians to be &quot; standing on their own feet &quot; ( berdikari ) and reach economic self-sufficiency , free from foreign influence .
towards the end of his rule , Sukarno &apos;s lack of interest in economics created a distance between himself and the Indonesian people , who were suffering economically .
his face had become bloated by disease and his flamboyance and sexual conquests – which had once endeared him to the people – caused public criticism and turned support towards the army .
on the dawn of 1 October 1965 , six of Indonesia &apos;s most senior army generals were kidnapped and killed by a movement calling themselves the &quot; 30 September Movement &quot; ( G30S ) .
among those killed was Ahmad Yani , while Nasution narrowly escaped , but the movement kidnapped First Lieutenant Pierre Tendean , his military aide ; presumably mistaking him for General Nasution in the darkness .
the G30S Movement consisted of members of the Presidential Guards , Brawidjaja Division , and Diponegoro Division , under the command of a Lieutenant-Colonel Untung bin Sjamsuri , a known communist sympathiser who participated in the 1948 PKI rebellion .
the movement took control of the radio station and the Merdeka Square .
they broadcast a statement declaring the kidnappings were meant to protect Sukarno from a coup attempt by CIA-influenced generals .
later , it broadcast news of the disbandment of Sukarno &apos;s cabinet , to be replaced by a &quot; Revolutionary Council &quot; .
in Central Java , soldiers associated with the Movement also seized control of Yogyakarta and Solo on 1 – 2 October , killing two colonels in the process .
major General Suharto , commander of the Army &apos;s strategic reserve command , took control of the army the following morning .
Suharto ordered troops to take over the radio station of Radio Republik Indonesia and Merdeka Square itself .
on the afternoon of that day , Suharto issued an ultimatum to the Halim Air Force Base , where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno ( the reasons for his presence are unclear and were subject of claim and counter-claim ) , Air Marshal Omar Dhani , and PKI chairman Aidit had gathered .
by the following day , it was clear that the incompetently organised and poorly coordinated coup had failed .
Sukarno took up residence in the Bogor Palace , while Omar Dhani fled to East Java and Aidit to Central Java .
by 2 October , Suharto &apos;s soldiers occupied Halim Air Force Base , after a short gunfight .
Sukarno &apos;s obedience to Suharto &apos;s 1 October ultimatum to leave Halim is seen as changing all power relationships .
Sukarno &apos;s fragile balance of power between the military , political Islam , communists , and nationalists that underlay his &quot; Guided Democracy &quot; was now collapsing .
on 3 October , the corpses of the kidnapped generals were discovered near the Halim Air Force Base , and on 5 October they were buried in a public ceremony led by Suharto .
in early October 1965 , a military propaganda campaign began to sweep the country , successfully convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a Communist coup , and that the murders were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes since those who were shot were veteran military officers .
the PKI &apos;s denials of involvement had little effect .
following the discovery and public burial of the generals &apos; corpses on 5 October , the army along with Islamic organisations Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama , led a campaign to purge Indonesian society , government and armed forces of the communist party and other leftist organisations .
leading PKI members were immediately arrested , some summarily executed .
Aidit was captured and killed in November 1965 .
the purge spread across the country with the worst massacres in Java and Bali .
in some areas the army organised civilian groups and local militias , in other areas communal vigilante action preceded the army .
the most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed .
it is thought that as many as 1 .
5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another .
as a result of the purge , one of Sukarno &apos;s three pillars of support , the Indonesian Communist Party , had been effectively eliminated by the other two , the military and political Islam .
the killings and the failure of his tenuous &quot; revolution &quot; distressed Sukarno and he tried unsuccessfully to protect the PKI by referring to the generals &apos; killings as a rimpeltje in de oceaan ( &quot; ripple in the sea of the revolution &quot; ) .
he tried to maintain his influence appealing in a January 1966 broadcast for the country to follow him .
Subandrio sought to create a Sukarnoist column ( Barisan Sukarno ) , which was undermined by Suharto &apos;s pledge of loyalty to Sukarno and the concurrent instruction for all those loyal to Sukarno to announce their support for the army .
on 1 October 1965 , Sukarno appointed General Pranoto Reksosamudro as Army Chief to replace the dead Ahmad Yani , but he was forced to give this position to Suharto two weeks later .
in February 1966 , Sukarno reshuffled his cabinet , sacking Nasution as Defence Minister and abolishing his position of armed forces chief of staff , but Nasution refused to step down .
beginning in January 1966 , university students started demonstrating against Sukarno , demanding the disbandment of PKI and for the government to control spiraling inflation .
in February 1966 , student demonstrators in front of Merdeka Palace were shot at by Presidential Guards , killing the student Arief Rachman Hakim , who was quickly turned into a martyr by student demonstrators .
a meeting of Sukarno &apos;s full cabinet was held at the Merdeka Palace on 11 March 1966 .
as students were demonstrating against the administration , unidentified troops began to assemble outside .
Sukarno , Subandrio and another minister immediately left the meeting and went to the Bogor Palace by helicopter .
three pro-Suharto generals ( Basuki Rahmat , Amirmachmud , and Mohammad Jusuf ) were dispatched to the Bogor palace and they met with Sukarno who signed for them a Presidential Order known as Supersemar .
through the order , Sukarno assigned Suharto to &quot; take all measures considered necessary to guarantee security , calm and stability of the government and the revolution and to guarantee the personal safety and authority &#91; of Sukarno &#93; &quot; .
the authorship of the document , and whether Sukarno was forced to sign , perhaps even at gunpoint , is a point of historic debate .
the effect of the order , however , was the transfer of authority to Suharto .
after obtaining the Presidential Order , Suharto had the PKI declared illegal and the party was abolished .
he also arrested many high-ranking officials that were loyal to Sukarno on the charge of being PKI members and / or sympathizers , further reducing Sukarno &apos;s political power and influence .
on 22 June 1966 , Sukarno made the Nawaksara speech in front of the MPRS session , an unsuccessful last-ditch attempt to defend himself and his guided democracy system .
in August 1966 , over Sukarno &apos;s objections , Indonesia ended its confrontation with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations .
after making another unsuccessful accountability speech ( Nawaksara Addendum ) on 10 January 1967 , Sukarno was stripped of his president-for-life title by MPRS on 12 March 1967 , in a session chaired by his former ally , Nasution .
he was put under house arrest in Bogor Palace , where his health deteriorated due to denial of adequate medical care .
he died of kidney failure in Jakarta Army Hospital on 21 June 1970 at age 69 .
he was buried in Blitar , East Java , Indonesia .
Sukarno was of Javanese and Balinese descent .
Sukarno married Siti Oetari in 1920 , and divorced her in 1923 to marry Inggit Garnasih , whom he divorced c .
1943 to marry Fatmawati .
Sukarno also married Hartini in 1954 , after which he and Fatmawati separated without divorcing .
in 1959 , he was introduced to the then 19-year-old Japanese hostess Naoko Nemoto , whom he married in 1962 and renamed Ratna Dewi Sukarno .
Sukarno also married four other spouses : Haryati ( 1963 – 1966 ) ; Kartini Manoppo ( 1959 – 1968 ) ; Yurike Sanger ( 1964 – 1968 ) ; Heldy Djafar ( 1966 – 1969 ) .
Megawati Sukarnoputri , who served as the fifth president of Indonesia , is his daughter by his wife Fatmawati .
her younger brother Guruh Sukarnoputra ( born 1953 ) has inherited Sukarno &apos;s artistic bent and is a choreographer and songwriter , who made a movie Untukmu , Indonesiaku ( For You , My Indonesia ) about Indonesian culture .
he is also a member of the Indonesian People &apos;s Representative Council for Megawati &apos;s Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle .
his siblings Guntur Sukarnoputra , Rachmawati Sukarnoputri and Sukmawati Sukarnoputri have all been active in politics .
Sukarno had a daughter named Kartika by Dewi Sukarno .
in 2006 Kartika Sukarno married Frits Seegers , the Netherlands-born chief executive officer of the Barclays Global Retail and Commercial Bank .
other offspring include Taufan and Bayu by his wife Hartini , and a son named Toto Suryawan Soekarnoputra ( born 1967 , in Germany ) , by his wife Kartini Manoppo .

in Neo-Freudian psychology , the Electra complex , as proposed by Carl Gustav Jung , is a girl &apos;s psychosexual competition with her mother for possession of her father .
the Electra complex occurs in the third — phallic stage ( ages 3 – 6 ) — of five psychosexual development stages : ( I ) the Oral , ( ii ) the Anal , ( iii ) the Phallic , ( iv ) the Latent , and ( v ) the Genital — in which the source libido pleasure is in a different erogenous zone of the infant ’ s body .
as a psychoanalytic term for daughter – mother psychosexual conflict , the Electra complex derives from the Greek mythologic character Electra , who plotted matricidal revenge with Orestes , her brother , against Clytemnestra , their mother , and Aegisthus , their stepfather , for their murder of Agamemnon , their father ( cf .
Electra , by Sophocles ) .
Sigmund Freud developed the female aspects of the sexual development theory — describing the psychodynamics of a girl ’ s sexual competition with mother for sexual possession of father — as the feminine Oedipus attitude and the negative Oedipus complex ; yet it was his collaborator Carl Jung who coined the term Electra complex in 1913 .
Freud rejected Jung &apos;s term as psychoanalytically inaccurate : &quot; that what we have said about the Oedipus complex applies with complete strictness to the male child only , and that we are right in rejecting the term &apos; Electra complex &apos; , which seeks to emphasize the analogy between the attitude of the two sexes &quot; .
in forming a discrete sexual identity ( ego ) a girl &apos;s decisive psychosexual experience is the Electra complex — daughter – mother competition for possession of father .
in both sexes , defense mechanisms provide transitory resolutions of the conflicts between the drives of the Id and the drives of the ego .

sungnyung is a traditional Korean infusion made from boiled scorched rice .
this drink is typically made from nurungji , the roasted ( but not charred ) crust of rice that forms on the bottom of a pot after cooking rice .
water is poured on this brown crust and the contents are put to a simmer until the water gains enough flavor of the scorched rice .
records of sungnyung can be found in the late Joseon era documents of Imwon Gyeongjeji ( 임원경제지 ) and also in the 12th-century Chinese Song Dynasty &apos;s Gyerim Yusa ( hangul : 계림유사 , hanja : 鷄林類事 ) which supports the theory that sungnyung has been eaten since the Goryeo period .
however , in the late 20th century &apos; sungnyung &apos; began to gain popularity again and many electric rice cookers now come with the ability to cook sungnyung .
prepackaged nurungji are also commercially available and can be used to make sungnyung in a short of amount of time by just adding boiling water .
the series was aired in China through Anhui TV and in Taiwan through CTV .

swardspeak ( also known as Bekimon or Bekinese and &quot; gay lingo &quot; ) is an argot or cant slang derived from Taglish ( Tagalog-English code-switching ) and used by a number of homosexuals in the Philippines .
swardspeak uses elements from Tagalog , English , Spanish , and some from Japanese , as well as celebrities &apos; names and trademark brands , giving them new meanings in different contexts .
it is largely localized within gay communities , making use of words derived from the local languages or dialects , including Cebuano , Hiligaynon , Waray , and Bicolano .
a defining trait of swardspeak slang is that it more often than not immediately identifies the speaker as homosexual , making it easy for people of that orientation to recognize each other .
this creates an exclusive group among its speakers and helps them resist cultural assimilation .
more recently , though , even non-members of the gay community use this way of speaking , particularly heterosexual members of industries dominated by gays , such as the fashion and film industries .
by using swardspeak , Filipino gays are able to resist the dominant culture of their area and create a space of their own .
the language is constantly changing , with old phrases becoming obsolete and new phrases frequently entering everyday usage , reflecting changes in their culture and also maintaining exclusivity .
the dynamic nature of the language refuses to cement itself in a single culture and allows for more freedom of expression among its speakers .
by these characteristics , swardspeak creates a dissident group without any ties to geographical , linguistic , or cultural restrictions , thus allowing its speakers to shape the language as appropriate to the times .
in this way , the language is not only &quot; mobile &quot; and part of a larger community , but also open to more specific or local meanings .
gay people who speak the language almost exclusively are humorously called Bekimons ( a contraction of Baklang Jejemon , &apos; Gay Jejemons &apos; ) .
swardspeak is also spoken by babaeng bakla , women who associate exclusively or mostly with gay men ( literally &apos; gay women &apos; , though they are actually heterosexual ) .
the word &quot; Swardspeak &quot; , according to José Javier Reyes , was coined by columnist and film critic Nestor Torre in the 1970s .
Reyes himself wrote a book on the subject entitled &quot; Swardspeak : a Preliminary Study &quot; .
&quot; sward &quot; is slang for &apos; gay male &apos; in the Philippines .
the origin of the individual words and phrases , however , has existed longer and come from a variety of sources .
swardspeak is a form of slang ( and therefore highly dynamic , as opposed to colloquialisms ) that is built upon preexisting languages .
it deliberately transforms or creates words that resemble words from other languages , particularly English , Japanese , Chinese , Spanish , French , and German .
it is colorful , witty , and humorous , with vocabularies derived from popular culture and regional variations .
it is unintelligible to people not familiar with the Filipino gay culture or do not know the rules of usage .
there is no standardized set of rules , but some of the more common conventions are shown below : .

this list of kings and queens of the Kingdom of England begins with Alfred the Great , King of Wessex , one of the petty kingdoms to rule a portion of modern England .
while Alfred was not the first king to lay claim to rule all of the English , his rule represents the first unbroken line of Kings to rule the whole of England , the House of Wessex .
the last monarch of a distinct kingdom of England was Queen Anne , who became Queen of Great Britain when England merged with Scotland to form a union in 1707 .
for monarchs after Queen Anne , see List of British monarchs .
arguments are made for a few different kings deemed to control enough of the ancient kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons to be deemed the first King of England .
for example , Offa , king of Mercia , and Egbert , king of Wessex , are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers , but not by all historians .
&#91; citation needed &#93; In the late eighth century Offa achieved a dominance over southern England that did not survive his death in 796 .
in 829 Egbert conquered Mercia , but he soon lost control of it .
by the late ninth century Wessex was the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom .
its king , Alfred the Great , was overlord of western Mercia and used the title King of the Angles and Saxons , but he never ruled eastern and northern England , which was then the Danelaw .
his son Edward the Elder conquered the eastern Danelaw , but Edward &apos;s son Æthelstan became the first king to rule the whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927 , and he is regarded by some modern historians as the first king of England .
the Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 , and in 1301 King Edward I invested his eldest son , the future King Edward II , as Prince of Wales .
since that time , except for King Edward III , the eldest sons of all English monarchs have borne this title .
after the death of Queen Elizabeth I without issue , in 1603 , the crowns of England and Scotland were joined in personal union under King James VI of Scotland , who became James I of England .
by royal proclamation , James styled himself &quot; King of Great Britain &quot; , but no such kingdom was created until 1707 , when England underwent legislative union with Scotland to form the new Kingdom of Great Britain , during the reign of Queen Anne .
disputed claimant .
however , this is not accepted by all historians .
also , it is unclear whether Ælfweard was declared king of the whole kingdom or of Wessex only : there is evidence that when Edward died , Ælfweard was declared king in Wessex and Æthelstan in Mercia .
England came under the control of Sweyn Forkbeard , a Danish king , after an invasion in 1013 , during which Æthelred abandoned the throne and went into exile in Normandy .
following the death of Sweyn Forkbeard , Æthelred the Unready returned from exile and was again proclaimed king on 3 February 1014 .
his son succeeded him after being chosen king by the citizens of London and a part of the Witan , despite ongoing Danish efforts in wresting the crown from the West Saxons .
following the decisive Battle of Assandun on 18 October 1016 , King Edmund signed a treaty with Cnut in which all of England except for Wessex would be controlled by Cnut .
upon Edmund &apos;s death on 30 November , Cnut ruled the whole kingdom as its sole king .
after Harthacnut , there was a brief Saxon Restoration between 1042 and 1066 .
in 1066 , several rival claimants to the English throne emerged .
among them were Harold Godwinson , elected king by the Witenagemot after the death of Edward the Confessor , as well as Harald Hardrada , King of Norway who claimed to be the rightful heir of Harthacnut , and Duke William II of Normandy , descendant of Rollo , founder of the royal House of Normandy , vassal to the King of France , and first cousin once-removed of Edward the Confessor .
Harald and William both invaded separately in 1066 .
Godwinson successfully repelled the invasion by Hardrada , but ultimately lost the throne of England in the Norman conquest of England .
after the Battle of Hastings , William the Conqueror made permanent the recent removal of the capital from Winchester to London .
following the death of Harold Godwinson on 14 October , the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot elected as king Edgar the Ætheling , the son of Edward the Exile and grandson of Edmund Ironside , but the young monarch was unable to resist the invaders and was never crowned .
William was crowned King William I of England on Christmas Day 1066 , in Westminster Abbey , and is today known as William the Conqueror , William the Bastard or William I.
Henry I left no legitimate male heirs , his son William Adelin having died in the White Ship disaster .
this ended the direct Norman line of kings in England .
Henry named his eldest daughter , the dowager Empress Matilda as his heir .
before naming Matilda as heir , however , he had been in negotiations to name his nephew Stephen of Blois as his heir .
when Henry died , Stephen invaded England , and in a coup d &apos;etat had himself crowned instead of Matilda .
the period which followed is known as The Anarchy , as parties supporting each side fought in open warfare on both Britain and on the continent for the better part of two decades .
disputed claimants .
Empress Matilda was declared heir presumptive by her father , Henry I , after the death of her brother on the White Ship , and acknowledged as such by the barons .
however , upon Henry I &apos;s death , the throne was seized by Matilda &apos;s cousin , Stephen of Blois .
the Anarchy ensued , with Matilda being a de facto ruler for a few months in 1141 — the first woman so to be — but she was never crowned and is rarely listed as a monarch of England .
count Eustace IV of Boulogne ( c .
1130 – 17 August 1153 ) was appointed co-king of England by his father , King Stephen , on 6 April 1152 , in order to guarantee his succession to the throne ( as was the custom in France , but not in England ) .
however , the Pope and the Church would not agree to this , and Eustace was not crowned .
Eustace died the next year aged 22 , during his father &apos;s lifetime , and so never became king in his own right .
Stephen came to an agreement with Matilda in November 1153 with the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford , where Stephen recognised Prince Henry , son of Matilda and her second husband Geoffrey Plantagenet , Count of Anjou , as the heir-apparent to the throne in lieu of his own son , who had died that August .
the royal house descended from Matilda and Geoffrey is widely known by two names , the House of Anjou ( after Geoffrey &apos;s title as Count of Anjou ) or the House of Plantagenet , after his sobriquet .
some historians prefer to group the subsequent kings into two groups , before and after the loss of the Angevin Empire , although they are not different royal houses .
the Angevins ruled over the Angevin Empire during the 12th and 13th centuries , an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Ireland .
they did not regard England as their primary home until most of their continental domains were lost by John .
though the Angevin Dynasty was short-lived , their male line descendants included the House of Plantagenet , the House of Lancaster and the House of York .
the Angevins formulated England &apos;s royal coat of arms , which usually showed other kingdoms held or claimed by them or their successors , although without representation of Ireland for quite some time .
Dieu et mon droit has generally been used as the motto of English monarchs since being adopted by Edward III , but it was first used as a battle cry by Richard I in 1198 at the Battle of Gisors , when he defeated the forces of Philip II of France , after which , he made it his motto .

Henry II named his son , another Henry ( 1155 – 1183 ) , as co-ruler with him .
disputed claimant .
Louis VIII of France briefly ruled about half of England from 1216 to 1217 at the conclusion of the First Barons &apos; War against King John .
on marching into London he was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed ( though not crowned ) king at St Paul &apos;s cathedral .
many nobles , including Alexander II of Scotland for his English possessions , gathered to give homage to him .
however , in signing the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217 , Louis conceded that he had never been the legitimate king of England .
the House of Plantagenet takes its name from Geoffrey Plantagenet , Count of Anjou , husband of the Empress Matilda and father of Henry II .
the name Plantagenet itself was unknown as a family name per se until Richard of York adopted it as his family name in the 15th century .
it has since been retroactively applied to English monarchs from Henry II onward .
it is common among modern historians to refer to Henry II and his sons as the &quot; Angevins &quot; due to their vast continental Empire , most of the Angevin kings before John spent more time in their continental possessions than in England .
it is from the time of Henry III , after the loss of most of the family &apos;s continental possessions , that the Plantagenet kings became more English in nature .
the Houses of Lancaster and York are cadet branches of the House of Plantagenet .
( 2 ) Margaret of France 10 September 1299 three children .
( 2 ) Isabella of Valois Calais 4 November 1396 No children .
this house descended from Edward III &apos;s third surviving son , John of Gaunt .
Henry IV seized power from Richard II ( and also displaced the next in line to the throne , Edmund Mortimer ( then aged 7 ) , a descendant of Edward III &apos;s second son , Lionel of Antwerp ) .
( 2 ) Joanna of Navarre Winchester Cathedral 7 February 1403 No children .
the House of York inherited its name from the fourth surviving son of Edward III , Edmund , 1st Duke of York , but claimed the right to the throne through Edward III &apos;s second surviving son , Lionel of Antwerp .
the Wars of the Roses ( 1455 – 1485 ) saw the throne pass back and forth between the rival houses of Lancaster and York .
the Tudors descended matrilineally from John Beaufort , one of the illegitimate children of John of Gaunt ( third surviving son of Edward III ) , by Gaunt &apos;s long-term mistress Katherine Swynford .
those descended from English monarchs only through an illegitimate child would normally have no claim on the throne , but the situation was complicated when Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396 ( 25 years after John Beaufort &apos;s birth ) .
in view of the marriage , the church retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate via a papal bull the same year ( also enshrined in an Act of Parliament in 1397 ) .
a subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt &apos;s legitimate son , King Henry IV , also recognised the Beauforts &apos; legitimacy , but declared them ineligible ever to inherit the throne .
nevertheless , the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt &apos;s other descendants , the Royal House of Lancaster .
John Beaufort &apos;s granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort was married to Edmund Tudor .
Tudor was the son of Welsh courtier Owain Tudur ( anglicised to Owen Tudor ) and Catherine of Valois , the widowed queen consort of the Lancastrian King Henry V.
Edmund Tudor and his siblings were either illegitimate , or the product of a secret marriage , and owed their fortunes to the goodwill of their legitimate half-brother King Henry VI .
when the House of Lancaster fell from power , the Tudors followed .
by the late 15th century , the Tudors were the last hope for the Lancaster supporters .
Edmund Tudor &apos;s son became king as Henry VII after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 , ending the Wars of the Roses .
King Henry married Elizabeth of York , daughter of Edward IV , thereby uniting the Lancastrian and York lineages .
with Henry VIII &apos;s break from the Roman Catholic Church , the monarch became the Supreme Head of the Church of England and of the Church of Ireland .
Elizabeth I &apos;s title became the Supreme Governor of the Church of England .
disputed claimant .
Edward VI named Lady Jane Grey as his heir presumptive , overruling the order of succession laid down by Parliament in the Third Succession Act .
four days after his death on 6 July 1553 , Jane was proclaimed queen — the first of three Tudor women to be proclaimed queen regnant .
nine days after the proclamation , on 19 July , the Privy Council switched allegiance and proclaimed Edward VI &apos;s Catholic half-sister Mary .
Jane was executed in 1554 , aged 16 .
many historians do not consider her to have been a legitimate monarch .
under the terms of the marriage treaty between Philip I of Naples ( Philip II of Spain from 15 January 1556 ) and Queen Mary I , Philip was to enjoy Mary &apos;s titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last .
all official documents , including Acts of Parliament , were to be dated with both their names , and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple .
nonetheless , Philip was to co-reign with his wife .
as the new King of England could not read English , it was ordered that a note of all matters of state should be made in Latin or Spanish .
coins were minted showing the heads of both Mary and Philip , and the coat of arms of England ( right ) was impaled with Philip &apos;s to denote their joint reign .
acts which made it high treason to deny Philip &apos;s royal authority were passed in England and Ireland .
in 1555 , Pope Paul IV issued a papal bull recognising Philip and Mary as rightful King and Queen of Ireland .
following the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 without issue , her cousin , James VI , King of Scots , succeeded to the English throne as James I in the Union of the Crowns .
James was descended from the Tudors through his great-grandmother , Margaret Tudor , the eldest daughter of Henry VII .
in 1604 , he adopted the title King of Great Britain .
however , the two parliaments remained separate until the Acts of Union 1707 .
no monarch reigned between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 .
between 1649 and 1653 , there was no single English head of state , as England was ruled directly by the Rump Parliament during a period known as the Commonwealth of England .
after a coup d &apos;etat in 1653 , Oliver Cromwell forcibly took control of England from Parliament .
he dissolved the Rump Parliament at the head of a military force and England entered a period known as The Protectorate , under the direct control of a single individual known as the Lord Protector .
while not officially monarchs , the holder of the office of Lord Protector wielded great , almost absolute and dictatorial power over England , and the office became de facto hereditary when it passed from Oliver Cromwell to his son Richard .
Richard lacked both the ability to rule and confidence of the Army , and he was forcibly removed by the English Committee of Safety under the leadership of Charles Fleetwood in May 1659 .
England again lacked any single head of state during several months of conflict between Fleetwood &apos;s party and that of George Monck .
Monck took de facto control of the country in December 1659 , and after almost a year of anarchy , the monarchy was formally restored when Charles II returned from France to accept the throne of England following the Declaration of Breda and an invitation to reclaim the throne from the Convention Parliament of 1660 .
following the restoration of the Monarchy , England came under the rule of Charles II whose reign was relatively peaceful domestically , given the tumultuous time of the Interregnum years .
tensions still existed between Catholics and Protestants however , and with the ascension of his brother , the openly Catholic James II , England again was sent into a period of political turmoil .
James II was ousted by Parliament less than three years after ascending to the throne , and the throne was offered jointly to his daughter Mary and her husband ( also his first cousin once removed ) William during the Glorious Revolution .
while James and his descendants would continue to claim the throne , all Catholics ( such as James and his son Charles ) were barred from the throne by the Act of Settlement 1701 , enacted by Queen Anne , another of James &apos;s Protestant daughters .
after the Acts of Union 1707 , England as a sovereign state ceased to exist , replaced by the new Kingdom of Great Britain .
( 2 ) Mary of Modena Dover 21 November 1673 seven children .
the Acts of Union 1707 were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed during 1706 and 1707 by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland to put into effect the Treaty of Union agreed on 22 July 1706 .
the Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland ( previously separate sovereign states , with separate legislatures but with the same monarch ) into the Kingdom of Great Britain .
England , Scotland , and Ireland had shared a monarch for more than a hundred years , since the Union of the Crowns in 1603 , when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones from his first cousin twice removed , Queen Elizabeth I.
although described as a Union of Crowns , until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head .
there had been attempts in 1606 , 1667 , and 1689 , to unite England and Scotland by Acts of Parliament , but it was not until the early eighteenth century that the idea had the support of both political establishments behind it , albeit for rather different reasons .
for monarchs after 1707 , see List of British monarchs .
the standard title for all monarchs from Æthelstan until the time of King John was Rex Anglorum ( &quot; King of the English &quot; ) .
in addition , many of the pre-Norman kings assumed extra titles , as follows : .
in the Norman period Rex Anglorum remained standard , with occasional use of Rex Anglie ( &quot; King of England &quot; ) .
the Empress Matilda styled herself Domina Anglorum ( &quot; Lady of the English &quot; ) .
from the time of King John onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of Rex or Regina Anglie .
in 1604 James I , who had inherited the English throne the previous year , adopted the title ( now usually rendered in English rather than Latin ) King of Great Britain .

the area is a territory of the Philippines which was claimed , as part of its continental shelf , which was then lodged with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf on April 8 , 2009 and was approved by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) in 2012 .
there has been speculation in the scientific community about the nature of the landform .
on 8 April 2009 , the Republic of the Philippines lodged a partial territorial waters claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in relation to the continental shelf in the region of Benham Rise .
according to the government &apos;s claim , based on a set of guidelines by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf , the area satisfies the 350-mile constraint line since the outer limits of the continental shelf are located landward of the constraint line , which is located 350 miles from the baselines where the measurement of the breadth of the territorial sea begins .
the Congress of the Philippines enacted Republic Act No .
9522 , also known as the Archipelagic Baselines Law , which is the basis of the claim .
according to the document the region is bounded by the Philippine Basin on the north and east , and by Luzon on the west and south .
it asserted that , according to scientific data based on seismic , magnetic , other geological features , the Benham Rise is an extension of the Philippines ’ continental shelf .
in summary , the baselines , the basis used for delineating the maritime territorial and jurisdictional zones ( including the continental shelf ) , conform with the requirements of the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) .
the claim is only a partial claim since the law that allows the Philippines to expand its territorial boundaries also includes islands in the South China Sea .
the Philippines filed its claim for Benham Rise in 2008 in compliance with the requirements of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) .
the UN has officially approved the claim in April 2012 .

generally tendinitis is referred to by the body part involved , such as Achilles tendinitis ( affecting the Achilles tendon ) , or patellar tendinitis ( jumper &apos;s knee , affecting the patellar tendon ) .
tendinitis injuries are common in the upper shoulder and lower section of the elbow ( including the rotator cuff attachments ) , and are less common in the hips and torso .
individual variation in frequency and severity of tendinitis will vary depending on the type , frequency and severity of exercise or use ; for example , rock climbers tend to develop tendinitis in their fingers or elbows , swimmers in their shoulders .
Achilles tendinitis is a common injury , particularly in sports that involve lunging and jumping , while Patellar tendinitis is a common among basketball and volleyball players owing to the amount of jumping and landing .
a veterinary equivalent to Achilles tendinitis is bowed tendon , tendinitis of the superficial digital tendon of the horse .
with this condition , the pain is usually worse during and after activity , and the tendon and joint area can become stiff the following day as muscles tighten from the movement of the tendon .
many patients report stressful situations in their life in correlation with the beginnings of pain which may contribute to the symptoms .
if the symptoms of tendinitis last for several months ( 6 months ) or longer , it is probably tendinosis .
treatment of tendon injuries is largely conservative .
resting assists in the prevention of further damage to the tendon .

Hemmings &apos; first video , a cover of Mike Posner &apos;s &quot; Please Don &apos;t Go &quot; , was posted on 3 February 2011 .
despite having had no promotion apart from on Facebook and Twitter , their first music release , an EP entitled Unplugged , reached number 3 on the iTunes chart in Australia and the Top 20 in both New Zealand and Sweden .
their international following increased significantly once again when One Direction member Louis Tomlinson posted the link to their YouTube video of their song &quot; Gotta Get Out &quot; , stating that he &apos;d been a fan of 5 Seconds of Summer &quot; for a while &quot; .
5 Seconds of Summer were once again the subject of interest for One Direction following the release of their first single , &quot; Out of My Limit &quot; , on 19 November 2012 , this time with Niall Horan tweeting the link to the video clip .
5 Seconds of Summer spent the second half of 2012 writing and developing their sound with Christian Lo Russo and Joel Chapman of Australian band Amy Meredith , with whom they wrote two of the songs that feature on their second EP Somewhere New : &quot; beside You &quot; and &quot; Unpredictable &quot; .
the EP was also co-produced by Joel Chapman .
5 Seconds of Summer released their first single &quot; Out of My Limit &quot; on 19 November 2012 , with the video clip for the song receiving over 100,000 views within the first 24 hours .
in December 2012 , the boys embarked on a songwriting trip to London , where they wrote with various artists including McFly , Roy Stride of Scouting for Girls , Nick Hodgson of Kaiser Chiefs , Jamie Scott , Jake Gosling , Steve Robson and James Bourne of Busted .
the tour kicked off at the O2 Arena in London on 23 February 2013 , and 5 Seconds of Summer joined One Direction for shows in the UK , US , Australia and New Zealand , including seven shows at Allphones Arena in 5 Seconds of Summer &apos;s home town of Sydney .
whilst on a break from the Take Me Home Tour , 5 Seconds of Summer returned home to Australia where they played a National headlining tour , with all dates selling out within minutes .
it was around this time when the band began to gain popularity and become more well-known .
on 21 November 2013 , the band announced that they had signed to Capitol Records .
on 5 February 2014 , 5 Seconds of Summer listed their debut major label single &quot; She Looks So Perfect &quot; for pre-order on the iTunes Store .
the connection between 5SOS and One Direction extends to both artists being managed by London-based Modest Management .
this has led to 5SOS being called a boy band in the media .
members of the band have said the group is not a boy band .
unlike many boy bands , they write their own songs , play their own instruments , and they are not primarily a dance group .
nevertheless , the band has attracted a fanatical following of girls much like other boy bands .
Ashton Irwin has compared the band &apos;s female following to Fall Out Boy which also has a sizable female fanbase .
John Feldmann , frontman of Goldfinger and producer on 5 Seconds of Summer , attributes 5 Seconds of Summer &apos;s fanbase to &quot; a fundamental change in the pop punk demo &#91; graphic &#93; &quot; , mentioning the gradual demographic shift away from the majority male audiences of early 1990s pop punk acts such as Blink-182 and Green Day .
in late March 2014 , &quot; She Looks So Perfect &quot; was released in UK .
despite only one day on top in the British iTunes store and ending its week in the lower end of the top 10 , 5 Seconds of Summer became only the fourth Australian band to have a UK number-one single , and the first to do so in 14 years .
on 9 April 2014 , their third EP She Looks So Perfect debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 .
on 9 May , they released their second single , &quot; Don &apos;t Stop &quot; .
Billboard said &apos; In the vein of Green Day &apos;s &quot; She &quot; and Blink-182 &apos;s &quot; All The Small Things , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t Stop &quot; is 5SOS &apos; bid for a deceptively charming pop-punk anthem , with lyrics that are stickily sweet in their awkward flirtatiousness .
the bridge could be more polished , but that hook is a highlight of the whole album &apos; .
it peaked at 1 in 4 countries and was in the top 10 for 8 countries overall .
1 in 13 countries as well as the Top 10 in 26 countries .
the band released their first live album , LiveSOS , on 15 December 2014 .
Tenri ( 天理市 , Tenri-shi ? ) is a city located in Nara Prefecture , Japan .
another common scenario is when two people &apos;s attraction is limited to physical , with there being no emotional attraction .
sexual tension can also occur when two individuals have previously had sexual relations and still feel an attraction towards each other , but do not wish to have sex again for fear of its effect on their current social situation ( such as maintaining a relationship with a different partner ) .
it can also be felt in situations when two individuals have a relation devoid of physical contact , as in a long-distance relationship .
sexual tension often occurs between individuals when the relationship is close and often flirtatious , yet the two people involved adamantly deny their feelings for each other to themselves , and to others .
meanwhile , it can be extremely obvious to other friends / co-workers that such tension is present between the two individuals .
it can be said that , often when people give in to sexual tension , the relationship can become complicated and awkward if no new relationship level is established , as the relationship that existed before the sex is , in a way , no longer valid .
sexual tension is a common feature of plot and characterization in works of fiction .
in differential geometry , the Einstein tensor ( named after Albert Einstein ; also known as the trace-reversed Ricci tensor ) is used to express the curvature of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold .
in general relativity , it occurs in the Einstein field equations for gravitation that describe spacetime curvature in a manner consistent with energy and momentum conservation .
the Einstein tensor G { \ displaystyle \ mathbf { G } } is a tensor of order 2 defined over pseudo-Riemannian manifolds .
in index-free notation it is defined as .
where R { \ displaystyle \ mathbf { R } } is the Ricci tensor , g { \ displaystyle \ mathbf { g } } is the metric tensor and R { \ displaystyle R } is the scalar curvature .
in component form , the previous equation reads as .
the Einstein tensor is symmetric .
and , like the stress – energy tensor , divergenceless .
the Ricci tensor depends only on the metric tensor , so the Einstein tensor can be defined directly with just the metric tensor .
however , this expression is complex and rarely quoted in textbooks .
the complexity of this expression can be shown using the formula for the Ricci tensor in terms of Christoffel symbols : .
where δ β α { \ displaystyle \ delta _ { \ beta } ^ { \ alpha } } is the Kronecker tensor and the Christoffel symbol Γ α β γ { \ displaystyle \ Gamma ^ { \ alpha } { } _ { \ beta \ gamma } } is defined as .
before cancellations , this formula results in 2 × ( 6 + 6 + 9 + 9 ) = 60 { \ displaystyle 2 \ times ( 6 + 6 + 9 + 9 ) = 60 } individual terms .
cancellations bring this number down somewhat .
in the special case of a locally inertial reference frame near a point , the first derivatives of the metric tensor vanish and the component form of the Einstein tensor is considerably simplified : .
where square brackets conventionally denote antisymmetrization over bracketed indices , i .
the trace of the Einstein tensor can be computed by contracting the equation in the definition with the metric tensor g μ ν { \ displaystyle g ^ { \ mu \ nu } } .
in n { \ displaystyle n } dimensions ( of arbitrary signature ) : .
the special case of n = 4 dimensions in physics ( 3 space , 1 time ) gives G { \ displaystyle G \ , } , the trace of the Einstein tensor , as the negative of R { \ displaystyle R \ , } , the Ricci tensor &apos;s trace .
thus another name for the Einstein tensor is the trace-reversed Ricci tensor .
the Bianchi identities can also be easily expressed with the aid of the Einstein tensor : .

information theory studies the quantification , storage , and communication of information .
it was originally proposed by Claude E.
applications of fundamental topics of information theory include lossless data compression ( e .
zip files ) , lossy data compression ( e .
MP3s and JPEGs ) , and channel coding ( e .
for Digital Subscriber Line ( DSL ) ) .
important sub-fields of information theory include source coding , channel coding , algorithmic complexity theory , algorithmic information theory , information-theoretic security , and measures of information .
information theory studies the transmission , processing , utilization , and extraction of information .
information theory is a broad and deep mathematical theory , with equally broad and deep applications , amongst which is the vital field of coding theory .
these codes can be roughly subdivided into data compression ( source coding ) and error-correction ( channel coding ) techniques .
in the latter case , it took many years to find the methods Shannon &apos;s work proved were possible .
a third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms ( both codes and ciphers ) .
concepts , methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in cryptography and cryptanalysis .
prior to this paper , limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs , all implicitly assuming events of equal probability .
the unit of information was therefore the decimal digit , much later renamed the hartley in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information .
Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers .
much of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of thermodynamics by Ludwig Boltzmann and J.
Willard Gibbs .
connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy , including the important contributions by Rolf Landauer in the 1960s , are explored in Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory .
with it came the ideas of .
information theory is based on probability theory and statistics .
important quantities of information are entropy , a measure of information in a single random variable , and mutual information , a measure of information in common between two random variables .
the choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the unit of information entropy that is used .
a common unit of information is the bit , based on the binary logarithm .
other units include the nat , which is based on the natural logarithm , and the hartley , which is based on the common logarithm .
suppose one transmits 1000 bits ( 0s and 1s ) .
between these two extremes , information can be quantified as follows .
if 𝕏 is the set of all messages { x1 , … , xn } that X could be , and p ( x ) is the probability of some x ∈ X { \ displaystyle x \ in \ mathbb { X } } , then the entropy , H , of X is defined : .
( here , I ( x ) is the self-information , which is the entropy contribution of an individual message , and 𝔼X is the expected value .
) A property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable p ( x ) = 1 / n ; i .
, most unpredictable , in which case H ( X ) = log n .
the special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes is the binary entropy function , usually taken to the logarithmic base 2 , thus having the shannon ( Sh ) as unit : .
the joint entropy of two discrete random variables X and Y is merely the entropy of their pairing : ( x , Y ) .
this implies that if X and Y are independent , then their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies .
despite similar notation , joint entropy should not be confused with cross entropy .
the conditional entropy or conditional uncertainty of X given random variable Y ( also called the equivocation of X about Y ) is the average conditional entropy over Y : .
because entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value , care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy , the former of which is in more common use .
a basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that : .
mutual information measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another .
it is important in communication where it can be used to maximize the amount of information shared between sent and received signals .
the mutual information of X relative to Y is given by : .
where SI ( Specific mutual Information ) is the pointwise mutual information .
a basic property of the mutual information is that .
that is , knowing Y , we can save an average of I ( X ; Y ) bits in encoding X compared to not knowing Y.
mutual information is symmetric : .
mutual information can be expressed as the average Kullback – Leibler divergence ( information gain ) between the posterior probability distribution of X given the value of Y and the prior distribution on X : .
in other words , this is a measure of how much , on the average , the probability distribution on X will change if we are given the value of Y.
this is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution : .
mutual information is closely related to the log-likelihood ratio test in the context of contingency tables and the multinomial distribution and to Pearson &apos;s χ2 test : mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables , and has a well-specified asymptotic distribution .
the Kullback – Leibler divergence ( or information divergence , information gain , or relative entropy ) is a way of comparing two distributions : a &quot; true &quot; probability distribution p ( X ) , and an arbitrary probability distribution q ( X ) .
if we compress data in a manner that assumes q ( X ) is the distribution underlying some data , when , in reality , p ( X ) is the correct distribution , the Kullback – Leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessary for compression .
it is thus defined .
although it is sometimes used as a &apos; distance metric &apos; , KL divergence is not a true metric since it is not symmetric and does not satisfy the triangle inequality ( making it a semi-quasimetric ) .
another interpretation of the KL divergence is the &quot; unnecessary surprise &quot; introduced by a prior from the truth : suppose a number X is about to be drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution p ( x ) .
if Alice knows the true distribution p ( x ) , while Bob believes ( has a prior ) that the distribution is q ( x ) , then Bob will be more surprised than Alice , on average , upon seeing the value of X.
the KL divergence is the ( objective ) expected value of Bob &apos;s ( subjective ) surprisal minus Alice &apos;s surprisal , measured in bits if the log is in base 2 .
in this way , the extent to which Bob &apos;s prior is &quot; wrong &quot; can be quantified in terms of how &quot; unnecessarily surprised &quot; it &apos;s expected to make him .
other important information theoretic quantities include Rényi entropy ( a generalization of entropy ) , differential entropy ( a generalization of quantities of information to continuous distributions ) , and the conditional mutual information .
coding theory is one of the most important and direct applications of information theory .
it can be subdivided into source coding theory and channel coding theory .
using a statistical description for data , information theory quantifies the number of bits needed to describe the data , which is the information entropy of the source .
this division of coding theory into compression and transmission is justified by the information transmission theorems , or source – channel separation theorems that justify the use of bits as the universal currency for information in many contexts .
however , these theorems only hold in the situation where one transmitting user wishes to communicate to one receiving user .
in scenarios with more than one transmitter ( the multiple-access channel ) , more than one receiver ( the broadcast channel ) or intermediary &quot; helpers &quot; ( the relay channel ) , or more general networks , compression followed by transmission may no longer be optimal .
network information theory refers to these multi-agent communication models .
any process that generates successive messages can be considered a source of information .
a memoryless source is one in which each message is an independent identically distributed random variable , whereas the properties of ergodicity and stationarity impose less restrictive constraints .
all such sources are stochastic .
these terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory .
information rate is the average entropy per symbol .
that is , the conditional entropy of a symbol given all the previous symbols generated .
for the more general case of a process that is not necessarily stationary , the average rate is .
that is , the limit of the joint entropy per symbol .
for stationary sources , these two expressions give the same result .
it is common in information theory to speak of the &quot; rate &quot; or &quot; entropy &quot; of a language .
this is appropriate , for example , when the source of information is English prose .
the rate of a source of information is related to its redundancy and how well it can be compressed , the subject of source coding .
communications over a channel — such as an ethernet cable — is the primary motivation of information theory .
consider the communications process over a discrete channel .
a simple model of the process is shown below : .
here X represents the space of messages transmitted , and Y the space of messages received during a unit time over our channel .
let p ( y &#124; x ) be the conditional probability distribution function of Y given X.
we will consider p ( y &#124; x ) to be an inherent fixed property of our communications channel ( representing the nature of the noise of our channel ) .
then the joint distribution of X and Y is completely determined by our channel and by our choice of f ( x ) , the marginal distribution of messages we choose to send over the channel .
under these constraints , we would like to maximize the rate of information , or the signal , we can communicate over the channel .
the appropriate measure for this is the mutual information , and this maximum mutual information is called the channel capacity and is given by : .
this capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate R ( where R is usually bits per symbol ) .
for any information rate R &lt; C and coding error ε &gt; 0 , for large enough N , there exists a code of length N and rate ≥ R and a decoding algorithm , such that the maximal probability of block error is ≤ ε ; that is , it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error .
in addition , for any rate R &gt; C , it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error .
channel coding is concerned with finding such nearly optimal codes that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity .
information theoretic concepts apply to cryptography and cryptanalysis .
Turing &apos;s information unit , the ban , was used in the Ultra project , breaking the German Enigma machine code and hastening the end of World War II in Europe .
the security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time .
information theoretic security refers to methods such as the one-time pad that are not vulnerable to such brute force attacks .
in such cases , the positive conditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext ( conditioned on the key ) can ensure proper transmission , while the unconditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext remains zero , resulting in absolutely secure communications .
in other words , an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key .
AD 5 ( V ) was a common year starting on Thursday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar .
at the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Messalla and Cinna ( or , less frequently , year 758 Ab urbe condita ) .
the denomination &quot; AD 5 &quot; for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .
a critic using Darwinian literary studies might use arguments from the evolutionary psychology of religion .
such a disagreement cannot be easily resolved , because it is inherent in the radically different terms and goals ( that is , the theories ) of the critics .

Tokyo Mew Mew ( 東京ミュウミュウ , Tōkyō Myū Myū ? ) is a Japanese shōjo manga series written by Reiko Yoshida and illustrated by Mia Ikumi .
it was originally serialized in Nakayoshi from September 2000 to February 2003 , and later published in seven tankōbon volumes by Kodansha from February 2001 to April 2003 .
it focuses on five girls infused with the DNA of endangered animals which gives them special powers and allows them to transform into &quot; Mew Mews .
&quot; led by Ichigo Momomiya , the girls protect the earth from aliens who wish to &quot; reclaim &quot; it .
the series was adapted into a 52 episode anime series by Studio Pierrot .
it debuted in Japan on April 6 , 2002 , on both TV Aichi and TV Tokyo ; the final episode aired on March 29 , 2003 .
a two-volume sequel to the manga , Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode , was serialized in Nakayoshi from April 2003 to February 2004 .
two video games were also created for the series : a puzzle adventure game for the Game Boy Advance system and a role-playing video game for the PlayStation .
4Kids Entertainment licensed the anime series for North American broadcast under the name Mew Mew Power .
heavily edited and dubbed , 23 episodes of Mew Mew Power aired on the 4Kids TV channel in the United States and 26 episodes aired on YTV in Canada .
4Kids Entertainment was unable to license the remaining 26 episodes of the series , thus were unable to complete its broadcast .
they have never released the series to home video .
well received by English-language readers , several volumes of the manga series appeared in the Top 50 sales lists for graphic novels in their respective months of release .
critics praised the manga as a cute and entertaining series with free-flowing style and character designs .
a la mode received praise as a good continuation of the series , but was also criticized for offering nothing new .
the anime adaptation received high ratings while airing in Japan , resulting in numerous marketing tie-ins .
despite criticism for extensive editing that removed most of the Japanese elements , the Mew Mew Power dub became the highest rated 4Kids show during its broadcast .
it was licensed for regional release in several other countries instead of the original Japanese series .
in Tokyo , Japan , a young girl named Ichigo Momomiya attends an endangered species exhibit with her &quot; crush &quot; and future boyfriend Masaya Aoyama .
after an earthquake , Ichigo and four other girls are bathed in a strange light .
a cat appears before Ichigo , then merges with her .
Ryou and Keiichirou explain that this allows her to transform into Mew Ichigo , a powerful heroic cat girl .
she is ordered to defeat Chimera Animas — alien parasites which infect animals and turn them into monsters .
Ryou and Keiichirou instruct Ichigo to find the four other girls from the exhibit — the remaining Mew Mews .
the five Mew Mews battle the Chimera Animas and their alien controllers Kishu , Pai and Taruto .
Kishu falls in love with Ichigo where he tries to gain her love despite the fact that he is trying to eliminate the other Mew Mews .
Pai and Taruto later join Kishu in trying to destroy the Mew Mews .
as the fighting intensifies , the Mew Mews are tasked with finding &quot; Mew Aqua &quot; , a material created from pure water that contains immense power for combating the alien attacks and can be sensed by the Mew Mews .
during a battle with Kishu at an aquarium , Ichigo is in danger of losing when the mysterious Blue Knight appears and rescues her .
it is later revealed that the Blue Knight is in fact Masaya .
shortly after this discovery , Masaya collapses and transforms again .
after explaining to Ichigo that Masaya was a false form for temporary use , Deep Blue attacks the Mew Mews .
crying over his body , Ichigo pours her power into Masaya to save his life , losing her own in the process .
Masaya kisses her , changing her back to a human and revives her .
Ryou gives Pai the remaining Mew Aqua to save the aliens &apos; world , after which Kisshu , Pai , and Taruto say their goodbyes and return to their own world .
in the two-volume sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode , Ichigo and Masaya move to England to study endangered species .
the remaining Mew Mews continue to eliminate the Chimera Animas left behind by the aliens .
they face a new threat in the form of the Saint Rose Crusaders : humans with special powers who desire to conquer the world and create a utopia while taking over the remaining Chimera Animas .
Berry Shirayuki becomes the sixth Mew Mew and temporarily takes Ichigo &apos;s place as the leader .
Berry is the first Mew Mew to be infused with the DNA of two endangered species , the Andean mountain cat and the Amami rabbit .
as one of the strongest Mew Mews , Berry is targeted by two of the Crusaders , who attack her at school .
Ichigo returns to provide assistance during this battle .
for their final attack , two Crusaders hypnotize the citizens of Tokyo and set them against the Mew Mews .
Berry and her childhood friend Tasuku Meguro use their new-found feelings of love to reverse the hypnosis and cause a change of heart in the Crusaders .
Mia Ikumi spent a year designing the Tokyo Mew Mew manga before the release of the first volume in February 2001 .
the story she originally presented to her editors , Tokyo Black Cat Girl , featured a heroine named Hime Azumi .
an intergalactic police officer named Masha gave her the ability to transform into a cat-girl and asked her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Bugs .
after the production team decided to focus on five female superheroes , Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character .
she had reservations about the changes , as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series .
as Tokyo Mew Mew became a viable project , Kodansha hired Reiko Yoshida to be the series &apos; scenario writer and story supervisor .
Yoshida and two other editors determined each volume &apos;s plot , created a scenario by adding stage directions and dialogue , and presented it to Ikumi .
Ikumi added her own ideas and changes , creating the manuscript &apos;s first draft , which was taken to the publishers for final review and approval .
this differs from most manga series , in which the manga writer also creates the scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval .
after the first volume &apos;s release , a two-day Tokyo Mew Mew festival was held during the Golden Week holiday — a week-long span in late April and early May during which four public holidays occur — to promote the series .
events included a Tokyo Mew Mew art gallery and the release of new merchandise .
Ikumi , the series &apos; artist , created a special poster for the event , featuring all twelve characters .
she also cosplayed as characters from the series , as Mint Aizawa on one day and Lettuce Midorikawa on the other .
written by Reiko Yoshida and illustrated by Mia Ikumi , Tokyo Mew Mew was first serialized in Nakayoshi magazine between September 2000 and February 2003 .
the twenty-nine chapters were then compiled into seven tankōbon volumes by Kodansha .
the first volume was released on February 1 , 2001 , with the final volume released April 4 , 2003 .
in April 2003 , a sequel called Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode premiered in Nakayoshi .
running until February 2004 and written solely by Mia Ikumi , the sequel was published as two volumes .
Tokyo Mew Mew and Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode are licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop .
the first volume of the main series was released on June 1 , 2004 , with volumes released subsequently until the seventh volume was published on December 15 , 2005 .
the two volumes of Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode were released on June 7 and September 13 , 2005 , respectively .
unlike the Japanese releases , each Tokyopop chapter is named .
the main series is licensed for an English language release in Singapore by Chuang Yi .
Carlsen Comics has licensed the series , through its regional divisions , and released the series in German , Danish and Swedish .
the series is also licensed for regional language releases in French by Pika Édition , in Polish by Japonica Polonica Fantastica , and in Finnish by Sangatsu Manga .
Tokyo Mew Mew was one of the first manga series released in Spanish in North America by Public Square Books .
Pierrot , Tokyu Agency and AEON adapted Tokyo Mew Mew into a fifty-two episode anime series , directed by Noriyuki Abe .
broadcast on both TV Aichi and TV Tokyo , the series premiered on April 6 , 2002 , and aired weekly until its conclusion on March 29 , 2003 .
most of the music for the series was produced by Shin Yoshimura and composed by Takayuki Negishi .
two pieces of theme music were also used for the anime series .
&quot; my Sweet Heart &quot; , performed by Rika Komatsu , was the series opening theme .
the ending theme &quot; Koi wa A La Mode &quot; is performed by the five voice actors who play the Mew Mews .
in Japan , the series was released across nine Region 2 DVD volumes .
the ninth volume included a bonus DVD containing extra content .
Tokyo Mew Mew was later licensed for an English-language dubbed release by 4Kids Entertainment .
in its announcement about the series , 4Kids noted that the show would be renamed to Hollywood Mew Mew and that they would be heavily editing and localizing episodes so that viewers would not recognize its Japanese origins .
subsequent 4Kids press releases about the series referred to the new series as The Mew Mews and its original name Tokyo Mew Mew .
when the series premiered on Fox Kids on February 19 , 2005 , it aired under the name Mew Mew Power .
characters and episodes were renamed , scenes were cut and storylines were modified .
the music was replaced with a new score and the opening theme was replaced with the song &quot; Team Up &quot; , performed by Bree Sharp .
twenty-six episodes of Mew Mew Power aired on 4Kids Entertainment in the United States because 4Kids was unable to get a merchandising deal for the series and the English dub had stopped production .
the 4Kids episodes aired on YTV in Canada and on the Pop Girl satellite television channel in the United Kingdom ; these included three dubbed episodes not broadcast in the United States .
although Mew Mew Power has not been released to home video in North America , ten of the 4Kids episodes have been released to Region 4 DVD in Australia and New Zealand by Magna Pacific and all twenty-six 4Kids episodes were released to Region 2 DVD in South Africa .
Mew Mew Power was licensed for regional airing in French by Arès Films , which released nine dubbed 4Kids episodes to DVD in February 2006 as a single volume through Warner Home Vidéo France .
the company also licensed the remaining twenty-six episodes of the series that 4Kids had not obtained , releasing them in two DVD box sets through AK Vidéo .
two video games based on the Tokyo Mew Mew series were launched in 2002 by Takara .
the first , Hamepane Tokyo Mew Mew ( はめパネ 東京ミュウミュウ , Hamepane Tōkyō Myū Myū ? ) , a puzzle adventure game for the Game Boy Advance , was released in Japan on July 11 , 2002 .
the second title , Tōkyō Mew Mew – Enter the New Mew Mew ! – Serve Everyone Together ( 東京ミュウミュウ 登場 新ミュウミュウ ！ みんないっしょにご奉仕するにゃん , Tōkyō Myū Myū – Tōjō Shin Myū Myū ! Minna Issho ni Gohōshi suru Nyan ? ) , was released in Japan on December 5 , 2002 .
it is a PlayStation turn-based role-playing video game in which the player controls a new Mew Mew , Ringo Akai ( 赤井 りんご , Akai Ringo ? ) , as well as the original five heroines .
they must defend Ringo &apos;s island from Kish , the Chimera Animas and a new alien named Gateau du Roi ( ガトー · デュ · ロワ , Gatō dyu Rowa ? ) .
both Ringo Akai and Gateau were created by the manga &apos;s artist , Mia Ikumi , following design specifications from Takara .
the game uses voice actors from the anime series , with the two new characters voiced by Taeko Kawata and Ryōtarō Okiayu , respectively .
Ikumi was pleased with how both characters turned out and expressed a desire to use Ringo as a regular character in a future manga series .
Ringo later joined the other Mew Mews in the Petite Mew Mew bonus story in the second volume of Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode .
multiple music and character CDs have been released for the Tokyo Mew Mew series by King Records .
the first , a CD single , contained the full and karaoke versions of &quot; Koi wa A La Mode &quot; , performed by the five voice actors who played the Mew Mews , and a second song performed by Saki Nakajima , who voices Ichigo .
on July 24 , 2002 , a five-disc limited edition collector &apos;s box set was released containing character songs for each of the Mew Mews , performed by their respective voice actors and a remix of &quot; Koi wa A La Mode .
&quot; the individual character song discs were released as standalone CDs on September 4 , 2002 .
an additional character CD set , containing remixed versions of two songs from each individual album , followed on December 25 , 2002 .
a second character CD for Ichigo , containing five new tracks performed by Nakajima , was released on February 26 , 2003 .
the first full anime soundtrack , Tokyo Mew Mew Original Soundtrack was released on September 25 , 2002 , by NEC .

on March 26 , 2003 , two &quot; best of &quot; CDs were released for the anime series : Tokyo Mew Mew Super Best Hit – Cafe Mew Mew side and Tokyo Mew Mew Super Best Hit – Tokyo Mew Mew side .
each CD includes ten of the series &apos; &quot; most popular &quot; musical pieces .
the Tokyo Mew Mew manga series was well received by English-speaking audiences .
in March and April 2003 , the first volume sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively .
this put the volume at the low end of the top 50 sales for each month .
by 2004 , with most of the series released , it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop .
it was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime / Manga , based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops .
sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly ; however , both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004 .
the first volume of Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005 , with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series .
on the Nielsen Bookscan charts , the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot .
the second volume of à la Mode saw similar success , debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position , a result of the Mew Mew Power show appearing on 4Kids TV .
Tokyo Mew Mew was generally well received by reviewers , who described it as cute and entertaining .
though AnimeFringe &apos;s Patrick King notes that it is not a very intellectual series and that it avoids complex plot points , he lauded it as engrossing &quot; brain candy &quot; and an &quot; endearing action-romance &quot; that has no &quot; delusions of grandeur &quot; .
critics praised the artwork in both Tokyo Mew Mew and the sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode .
Ikumi &apos;s &quot; free flowing &quot; style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series .
criticism of Ikumi &apos;s art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers .
Patrick King of Animefringe stated : &quot; one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi &apos;s ultra-cute artwork .
Big eyes , cat ears , fuzzy tails , and short skirts all come together in a cuteness combo that &apos;s hard to resist .
&quot; according to Carlo Santos of Anime News Network , &quot; Mia Ikumi &apos;s artwork is perfectly suited to the story , and it is not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other shōjo material .
like many budding manga artist , Ikumi &apos;s greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits , and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds .
&quot; conversely , in writing for Manga : the Complete Guide , Shaenon Garrity criticizes the series , calling it &quot; uninspired &quot; , &quot; insipid &quot; and &quot; creative &#91; ly &#93; bankrupt &quot; and feeling it was &quot; clearly designed by its publisher to ride the magical girl tsunami for all it was worth : the creators &apos; marginal notes are filled with references to big book signings , photo shoots , and models hired to dress as the scantily clad preteen heroines .
&quot; she also remarks that the series makes poor use of its endangered species theme , while still having a &quot; preachy environmental theme &quot; .
over all Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode had more mixed reviews .
critics praised it for being a modern manga that typifies the magical girl formula , highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses .
Mike Dungan , of Mania Entertainment , considered the original series to be &quot; quite charming &quot; and felt that à la Mode was a good continuation of the series with the &quot; same fun and excitement &quot; as its predecessor .
others felt Berry was an overly shallow heroine and that the sequel offered nothing new for readers with the Saint Rose Crusaders &apos; costumes and plans being nothing more than concepts borrowed from Sailor Moon .
Janet Crocker , Shannon Fay and Chris Istel of Animefringe criticized A la Mode for having the character Duke dressed in a white robe similar to those used by the white supremacy group , the Ku Klux Klan .
Garrity felt à La Mode was a vehicle for referencing Tokyo Mew Mew fandom and merchandise and that Berry was a &quot; transparent wish-fulfillment protagonist &quot; .
the anime adaptation has been compared to Sailor Moon due to both having female protagonists ; five original team members with signature colors and powers , and similar plot lines .
Tokyo Mew Mew received high ratings in Japan with extensive merchandizing tie ins and marketing events to promote the series .
when 4Kids announced their licensing of the anime , heavily edited and localized , fans of the series were openly dismayed and began multiple campaigns to convince the company to release an uncut version of the series .
after previews of the retooled series were released , viewers were less disappointed , but still annoyed by the cultural shifting and still desired an uncut DVD release .
Mew Mew Power became a successful broadcast series for 4Kids , becoming the highest rated 4Kids show at the start of the fall 2005 season , but it was never released to DVD in North America .
the 4Kids dub , rather than original Japanese version , was subsequently licensed for broadcast in France , Latin America , Australia , New Zealand , Portugal , Greece , South Africa and Israel .

it is currently the 22nd largest wiki in the world by number of pages , having about 14,000 translators for over 120,000 pages from over 30 projects including MediaWiki , OpenStreetMap , Mifos , Encyclopedia of Life and MantisBT .
the main characteristic of translatewiki .
net and its engine , the Translate extension , is it being a wiki , so contribution is made easy to any web user , with a low or no barrier to entry .
quality is pursued by letting translators focus on what they &apos;re best at — translation — freeing them from all the other burdens .
translations are immediately available to the translator and is smoothly synchronised between a revision control system and translatable wiki pages without translator intervention .
in the best case , MediaWiki on Wikimedia projects , new localisations reach live sites within a day ( sometimes called &quot; continuous translation &quot; or &quot; continuous localization &quot; ) .
besides translation , it was developed with the characteristics of an integrated development environment for MediaWiki ( Nukawiki in 2005 ) , with a focus on improvement of internationalisation features .
at the end of 2007 Siebrand Mazeland joined the management of the website , which was moved to the current domain translatewiki .
in April 2008 , it already supported over 100 languages for MediaWiki and 200 of its extensions , &quot; making it one of the most translated software projects ever &quot; , as well as FreeCol .
since then , while being an independent volunteer project , it has been recognised as a major player in the global success of MediaWiki and the Wikimedia projects powered by it , like Wikipedia , in over 280 languages .
in 2009 it was improved by a Google Summer of Code project by Niklas Laxström .
in 2011 proofreading features were introduced .
in 2012 , its translation memory engine expanded to all Wikimedia projects using Translate .
in 2013 , the Translate platform underwent a major revamp through the &quot; Translate User eXperience &quot; project , or &quot; TUX &quot; , including &quot; changes in navigation , editor look and feel , translation area , filters , search , and color &amp; style &quot; .

tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body .
diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test ( TST ) or blood tests .
antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) .
5 million deaths .
tuberculosis may infect any part of the body , but most commonly occurs in the lungs ( known as pulmonary tuberculosis ) .
general signs and symptoms include fever , chills , night sweats , loss of appetite , weight loss , and fatigue .
significant nail clubbing may also occur .
tuberculosis may become a chronic illness and cause extensive scarring in the upper lobes of the lungs .
the reason for this difference is not clear .
in 15 – 20 % of active cases , the infection spreads outside the lungs , causing other kinds of TB .
these are collectively denoted as &quot; extrapulmonary tuberculosis &quot; .
in those with HIV , this occurs in more than 50 % of cases .
when it spreads to the bones , it is known as &quot; osseous tuberculosis &quot; , a form of osteomyelitis .
a potentially more serious , widespread form of TB is called &quot; disseminated tuberculosis &quot; , also known as miliary tuberculosis .
miliary TB currently makes up about 10 % of extrapulmonary cases .
the main cause of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) , a small , aerobic , nonmotile bacillus .
the high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics .
mycobacteria have an outer membrane lipid bilayer .
if a Gram stain is performed , MTB either stains very weakly &quot; Gram-positive &quot; or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall .
MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state for weeks .
in nature , the bacterium can grow only within the cells of a host organism , but M.
tuberculosis can be cultured in the laboratory .
the most common acid-fast staining techniques are the Ziehl – Neelsen stain and the Kinyoun stain , which dye acid-fast bacilli a bright red that stands out against a blue background .
Bovis , M.
africanum , M.
other known pathogenic mycobacteria include M.
leprae , M.
avium , and M.
a number of factors make people more susceptible to TB infections .
the most important risk factor globally is HIV ; 13 % of all people with TB are infected by the virus .
this is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa , where rates of HIV are high .
5 to 5 .
a person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10 – 15 ( or more ) other people per year .
about 90 % of those infected with M.
in those with HIV , the risk of developing active TB increases to nearly 10 % a year .
the primary site of infection in the lungs , known as the &quot; Ghon focus &quot; , is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe , or the lower part of the upper lobe .
tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream .
this is known as a Simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung .
tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory diseases .
macrophages , T lymphocytes , B lymphocytes , and fibroblasts aggregate to form granulomas , with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages .
bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant , resulting in latent infection .
people with this disseminated TB have a high fatality rate even with treatment ( about 30 % ) .
in many people , the infection waxes and wanes .
affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material .
during active disease , some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up .
Igra have similar limitations in those with HIV .
however , the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture .
nucleic acid amplification tests and adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB .
these tests , however , are not routinely recommended , as they rarely alter how a person is treated .
blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive , so they are not recommended .
the Mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for TB .
interferon gamma release assays ( IGRAs ) , on a blood sample , are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test .
szulgai , M.
marinum , and M.
IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test , but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone .
tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases .
the World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens , and a small decrease in case numbers .
the only available vaccine as of 2011 is Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) .
in children it decreases the risk of getting the infection by 20 % and the risk of infection turning into disease by nearly 60 % .
it is the most widely used vaccine worldwide , with more than 90 % of all children being vaccinated .
the immunity it induces decreases after about ten years .
as tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada , the United Kingdom , and the United States , BCG is administered to only those people at high risk .
part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive , reducing the test &apos;s use in screening .
a number of new vaccines are currently in development .
a number of targets they set were not achieved by 2015 , mostly due to the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis .
a tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is used primarily in public health programs .
treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria .
people with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life .
directly observed therapy , i .
where resistance to isoniazid is high , ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative .
if tuberculosis recurs , testing to determine to which antibiotics it is sensitive is important before determining treatment .
if multiple drug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) is detected , treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24 months is recommended .
extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs .
it was first observed in 2003 in Italy , but not widely reported until 2012 , and has also been found in Iran and India .
these dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5 – 10 % of these latent cases , often many years after infection .
the risk of reactivation increases with immunosuppression , such as that caused by infection with HIV .
in people coinfected with M.
tuberculosis and HIV , the risk of reactivation increases to 10 % per year .
studies using DNA fingerprinting of M.
roughly one-third of the world &apos;s population has been infected with M.
tuberculosis , with new infections occurring in about 1 % of the population each year .
however , most infections with M.
tuberculosis do not cause TB disease , and 90 – 95 % of infections remain asymptomatic .
in 2012 , an estimated 8 .
6 million chronic cases were active .
in 2010 , 8 .
8 million new cases of TB were diagnosed , and 1 .
45 million deaths occurred , most of these occurring in developing countries .
of these 1 .
45 million deaths , about 0 .
35 million occur in those also infected with HIV .
tuberculosis is the second-most common cause of death from infectious disease ( after those due to HIV / AIDS ) .
India had the largest total incidence , with an estimated 2 .
0 million new cases .
rates per 100,000 people in different areas of the world were : globally 178 , Africa 332 , the Americas 36 , Eastern Mediterranean 173 , Europe 63 , Southeast Asia 278 , and Western Pacific 139 in 2010 .
in Canada and Australia , tuberculosis is many times more common among the aboriginal peoples , especially in remote areas .
the rates of TB varies with age .
a comparison of the genes of M.
the BCG vaccine has limitations , and research to develop new TB vaccines is ongoing .
a number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials .
two main approaches are being used to attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines .
vaccines are hoped to play a significant role in treatment of both latent and active disease .
a number of groups , including the Stop TB Partnership , the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative , and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation , are involved with research .
among these , the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation received a gift of more than $ 280 million ( US ) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved vaccine against tuberculosis for use in high burden countries .
mycobacteria infect many different animals , including birds , rodents , and reptiles .

in the history of Christianity , the first seven ecumenical councils , from the First Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) to the Second Council of Nicaea ( 787 ) , represented an attempt by Church leaders to reach an orthodox consensus , restore peace and develop a unified Christendom .
Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox , Nestorian , and Roman Catholics , all trace the legitimacy of their clergy by apostolic succession back to this period and beyond , to the earlier period referred to as Early Christianity .
the Church of the East ( Nestorian ) accepts the first two of the seven councils , but rejects the third , the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) , and subsequent councils .
the Quinisext Council ( 692 ) , which attempted to establish the Pentarchy and which is not generally &#91; quantify &#93; considered one of the first seven ecumenical councils , is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church , which also considers that there have been many more ecumenical councils after the first seven .
the first scholar to consider this time period as a whole , Philip Schaff ( 1819-1893 ) , wrote The Seven Ecumenical Councils of the Undivided Church , first published in 1901 after his death .
these seven ecumenical councils are : .
however , not all of these councils have been universally recognised as ecumenical .
as indicated above , the Church of the East accepts only the first two , and Oriental Orthodoxy only three .
nontrinitarians , such as Oneness Pentecostals , Unitarians , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , Quakers , Christadelphians and Jehovah &apos;s Witnesses , reject the teachings of all seven .
Emperor Constantine convened this council to settle a controversial issue , the relation between Jesus Christ and God the Father .
the Emperor wanted to establish universal agreement on it .
Representatives came from across the Empire , subsidized by the Emperor .
previous to this council , the bishops would hold local councils , such as the Council of Jerusalem , but there had been no universal , or ecumenical , council .
the council drew up a creed , the original Nicene Creed , which received nearly unanimous support .
the council &apos;s description of &quot; God &apos;s only-begotten Son &quot; , Jesus Christ , as of the same substance with God the Father became a touchstone of Christian Trinitarianism .
the council also addressed the issue of dating Easter ( see Quartodecimanism and Easter controversy ) , recognised the right of the see of Alexandria to jurisdiction outside of its own province ( by analogy with the jurisdiction exercised by Rome ) and the prerogatives of the churches in Antioch and the other provinces and approved the custom by which Jerusalem was honoured , but without the metropolitan dignity .
the Council was opposed by the Arians , and Constantine tried to reconcile Arius , after whom Arianism is named , with the Church .
even when Arius died in 336 , one year before the death of Constantine , the controversy continued , with various separate groups espousing Arian sympathies in one way or another .
in 359 , a double council of Eastern and Western bishops affirmed a formula stating that the Father and the Son were similar in accord with the scriptures , the crowning victory for Arianism .
the opponents of Arianism rallied , and the First Council of Constantinople in 381 marked the final victory of Nicene orthodoxy within the Empire , though Arianism had by then spread to the Germanic tribes , among whom it gradually disappeared after the conversion of the Franks to Christianity in 496 .
in 331 , Constantine I commissioned Eusebius to deliver fifty Bibles for the Church of Constantinople .
Athanasius ( Apol .
for example , it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists , and that Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus are examples of these Bibles .
the form used by the Armenian Apostolic Church , which is part of Oriental Orthodoxy , has many more additions .
this fuller creed may have existed before the Council and probably originated from the baptismal creed of Constantinople .
the council also condemned Apollinarism , the teaching that there was no human mind or soul in Christ .
it also granted Constantinople honorary precedence over all churches save Rome .
the council did not include Western bishops or Roman legates , but it was later accepted as ecumenical in the West .
Theodosius II called the council to settle the Nestorian controversy .
Nestorius , Patriarch of Constantinople , opposed use of the term Theotokos ( Greek Η Θεοτόκος , &quot; God-Bearer &quot; ) .
this term had long been used by orthodox writers , and it was gaining popularity along with devotion to Mary as Mother of God .
he reportedly taught that there were two separate persons in the incarnate Christ , though whether he actually taught this is disputed .
the council deposed Nestorius , repudiated Nestorianism , and proclaimed the Virgin Mary as the Theotokos .
after quoting the Nicene Creed in its original form , as at the First Council of Nicaea , without the alterations and additions made at the First Council of Constantinople , it declared it &quot; unlawful for any man to bring forward , or to write , or to compose a different ( ἑτέραν ) Faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicæa .
the council repudiated the Eutychian doctrine of monophysitism , described and delineated the &quot; Hypostatic Union &quot; and two natures of Christ , human and divine ; adopted the Chalcedonian Definition .
in November 448 , a synod at Constantinople condemned Eutyches for unorthodoxy .
in 449 , Theodosius II summoned a council at Ephesus , where Eutyches was exonerated and returned to his monastery .
this council was later overturned by the Council of Chalcedon and labeled &quot; Latrocinium &quot; ( i .
, &quot; Robber Council &quot; ) .
this council condemned certain Nestorian writings and authors .
prior to the Second Council of Constantinople was a prolonged controversy over the treatment of three subjects , all considered sympathetic to Nestorianism , the heresy that there are two separate persons in the Incarnation of Christ .
Emperor Justinian condemned the Three Chapters , hoping to appeal to monophysite Christians with his anti-Nestorian zeal .
Monophysites believe that in the Incarnate Christ there is one nature , not two .
Eastern Patriarchs supported the Emperor , but in the West his interference was resented , and Pope Vigilius resisted his edict on the grounds that it opposed the Chalcedonian decrees .
Justinian &apos;s policy was in fact an attack on Antiochene theology and the decisions of Chalcedon .
the pope assented and condemned the Three Chapters , but protests in the West caused him to retract his condemnation .
the emperor called the Second Council of Constantinople to resolve the controversy .
the council , attended mostly by Eastern bishops , condemned the Three Chapters and , indirectly , the Pope Vigilius .
it also affirmed Constantinople &apos;s intention to remain in communion with Rome .
Vigilius declared his submission to the council , as did his successor , Pope Pelagius I.
the council was not immediately recognized as ecumenical in the West , and Milan and Aquileia even broke off communion with Rome over this issue .
the schism was not repaired until the late 6th century for Milan and the late 7th century for Aquileia .
Emperor Justinian &apos;s policy failed to reconcile the Monophysites .
third Council of Constantinople ( 680 – 681 ) : repudiated monothelitism , a doctrine that won widespread support when formulated in 638 ; the Council affirmed that Christ had both human and divine wills .
Quinisext Council ( = Fifth-Sixth Council ) or Council in Trullo ( 692 ) has not been accepted by the Roman Catholic Church .
since it was mostly an administrative council for raising some local canons to ecumenical status , establishing principles of clerical discipline , addressing the Biblical canon , without determining matters of doctrine , the Eastern Orthodox Church does not consider it to be a full-fledged council in its own right , viewing it instead as an extension of the fifth and sixth councils .
it gave ecclesiastical sanction to the Pentarchy as the government of the state church of the Roman Empire .
second Council of Nicaea ( 787 ) .
in 753 , Emperor Constantine V convened the Synod of Hieria , which declared that images of Jesus misrepresented him and that images of Mary and the saints were idols .
the Second Council of Nicaea restored the veneration of icons and ended the first iconoclasm .
in the 9th century , Emperor Michael III deposed Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople and Photius was appointed in his place .
Pope Nicholas I declared the deposition of Ignatius invalid .

Vicente Lukbán y Rilles or Vicente Lucbán Rilles ( February 11 , 1860 – November 16 , 1916 ) , was a Filipino officer in Emilio Aguinaldo &apos;s staff during the Philippine Revolution and the politico-military chief of Samar and Leyte during the Philippine-American War .
Lukbán was born in Labo , Camarines Norte on February 11 , 1860 to Agustin Lukbán of Ambos Camarines and Andrea Rilles of Lucban , Tayabas .
he completed his early education at Escuela Pia in Lucban , continued his studies at Ateneo Municipal de Manila , and took up Bachelor of Laws at the University of Santo Tomas and Colegio de San Juan de Letran .
he returned to Labo after resigning from his job at the Manila Court of First Instance .
he married Sofía Dízon Barba and the union produced four children : Cecilia , Félix , Agustín , and Vicente , Jr .
Sofía died after their last child was born .
Lukbán then left his children in the care of his siblings so that he could devote his time to the cause of the revolution .
Lukbán , thereafter , accepted the post of Justice of the Peace .
in 1884 , he was inducted into Freemasonry , Luz de Oriente ( &quot; Light of the Orient &quot; ) .
the organization had attracted many intellectuals and middle-class Filipinos to its ranks .
in 1886 , he stopped working in the judicial office and busied himself with agriculture and commerce in Bicol .
he formed La Cooperativa Popular aimed at promoting the cooperative business activities of small and medium scale producers with the aim to increase their income from the lands by selling their products without passing through middle men .
part of the profits of the cooperatives were secretly remitted to the revolutionary movement of Andrés Bonifacio , the Katipunan .
the cooperative also served as an effective covert means of spreading the ideals of the revolution .
their members could move around freely without arousing the suspicion of the Spanish authorities .
by 1896 , Lukbán had centralized the funds of the cooperatives into the coffers of the revolution .
he periodically remitted money to the evolving revolutionary movement .
at the same time , he acted as an emissary of the Katipunan unit in Bicol to gather information about the Spanish movements in Manila and to determine how such movements affected Bicol provinces .
on one of his trips to Manila , he was arrested by the guardia civiles , ( &quot; civil guards &quot; ) and charged with conspiring to overthrow the government .
he was imprisoned in Bilibid prison and tortured &#91; citation needed &#93; at Fort Santiago .
while Lukbán was still in prison , the Philippine Revolution began .
on August 18 , 1897 , he was released from jail , together with Juan Luna and immediately thereafter , joined the revolutionary government ’ s armed forces .
in the army , he was commissioned to serve as one of Emilio Aguinaldo &apos;s officers .
Lukbán was among the few who assisted Aguinaldo in planning war strategies and activities .
when the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was signed , he was asked by Aguinaldo to be one of the members of his party going into exile in Hong Kong .
Lukban spent his exile in Hong Kong studying military science under the Lord Commander Joseph Churchase of the British Naval command .
this enabled him to master the arts of soldiery — fencing , shooting , gunpowder and ammunitions preparations , and the planning and execution of war strategies and tactics .
shortly after Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine Independence in 1898 , Lukbán was sent to the Bicol region to direct military operations against the Spaniards .
his successes in Bicol ushered him into a new and challenging assignment : as Leyte and Samar &apos;s politico-military chief .
Lukbán married his second wife Paciencia Gonzales in Samar .
this union produced eight children : Victoria , Juan , María , Fidel , Rosita , Ramon , José and Lourdes .
nevertheless , Lukban was soon forced to retreat into the island &apos;s interior , leaving behind an organized resistance network .
Samareños caught cooperating with the Americans were executed swiftly and dramatically .
although bearing command responsibility for the Balangiga massacre , Lukbán learned about it a week later , on October 6 , 1901 .
other than a letter to town mayors encouraging them to follow the Balangiga example on the same date , there are no published records of his reaction to the news or later comment from him .
after Baldomero Aguinaldo ’ s capture in 1901 , Samar , under Lukbán &apos;s leadership , remained one of the few areas of Filipino resistance .
American troops encountered few enemies to fight in the open , finding themselves constantly harassed by Lukbán &apos;s guerrillas .
however , two prisoners later revealed the location of Lukbán ’ s secret headquarters along the Cadac-an River , Basey , Samar .
the prisoners warned that the fort was impregnable , but Major Littleton Waller sent scouts to investigate .
on November 17 , 1901 , Waller attacked with an amphibious assault team up the river , as Captains Bearss and Porter attacked by land with forces from Basey and Balangiga .
the amphibious assault was foiled by a Filipino trap , and Porter attacked alone .
the Filipino soldiers fled before machine gun fire , leaving scaling ladders behind for the Americans .
the retreating Filipinos were gunned down from behind as the American flag was raised above the garrison .
it was a clear victory for the United States , with 30 Filipinos dead and the capture of Lukbán and his lieutenants .
the war on Samar , however , would not truly be over until the rugged interior was conquered .
Lukban was captured on 27 April 1902 .
he was elected governor of Tayabas ( now Quezon province ) in 1912 and re-elected in 1916 .
he died at his Manila residence on November 16 , 1916 .
Piccio was born in Iloilo City .

Victor Schumann ( December 21 , 1841 – September 1 , 1913 ) was a physicist and spectroscopist who in 1893 discovered the vacuum ultraviolet .
Schumann wished to study the &quot; Extreme Ultraviolet &quot; region .
for this , he used a prism and lenses in fluorite instead of quartz allowing himself to be the first to measure spectra below 200 nm .
oxygen gas would absorb the radiation with a wavelength below 195 nm but Schumann placed the entire apparatus under vacuum .
he prepared his own photographic plates with a reduced layer of gelatin .
he published on the Hydrogen line in the spectrum of Nova Aurigae and in the spectrum of vacuum tubes .
his work opened the way to atomic emission spectroscopy , leading eventually to the discovery of the hydrogen spectral lines series ( Lyman series ) by Theodore Lyman in 1914 .

refusing to be made a tool for the furtherance of Perdiccas &apos;s ambitions , Brasidas set about the accomplishment of his main object , and , partly by the rapidity and boldness of his movements , partly by his personal charm and the moderation of his demands , succeeded during the course of the winter in winning over the important cities of Acanthus , Stagirus , Amphipolis and Toroni as well as a number of minor towns .
an attack on Eion was foiled by the arrival of Thucydides , the historian , at the head of an Athenian squadron .

I am not reading the Bible as Scripture … I am in fact not even a theist .
my view all along — and especially in the recent books — is first that the biblical narratives are indeed &apos; stories , &apos; often fictional and almost always propagandistic , but that here and there they contain some valid historical information .
that hardly makes me a &apos; maximalist .
archaeology as it is practiced today must be able to challenge , as well as confirm , the Bible stories .
some things described there really did happen , but others did not .
the most naïve &#91; misconception about Syro-Palestinian archaeology &#93; is that the rationale and purpose of &apos; biblical archaeology &apos; ( and , by extrapolation , Syro-Palestinian archaeology ) is simply to elucidate the Bible , or the lands of the Bible .
Dever joined the faculty at Lycoming College in autumn 2008 .

in a press statement , the DSWD condemned &apos; the emotional abuse and humiliation bestowed on a six-year-old child contestant &apos; .
the Commission on Human Rights ( CHR ) is currently pursuing an investigation of the program for violating Section 10 of Republic Act No .

the days that had passed since the show voluntarily went off the air on April 8 were counted .
in the decision of the board in which it suspended the Willing Willie show , it stated : .
the MTRCB as a government regulatory agency , and as a stakeholder in the television industry , realize the value of setting a good example to the viewing public in general , who are composed of all gender &#91; s &#93; and of all ages , and especially to children .
we should always promote the good , and not condone what is reckless .
there is a very thin line between exposition and exploitation .
when an uneducated impoverished man is in front of us , we are confronted with the question : &quot; what should we do ? &quot; to teach by setting a good example , and not take advantage of his state , and never allow him to wallow in his miseries .
a quick fix does not solve anything permanent .
the state of the Philippine television industry is a product of a long process of compromises , and quick-fixes .
these quick fixes may be likened to drugs that are so addicting we end up being trapped in its unending cycles of perpetuating poverty , and uneven power relations .
there is a saying that goes : &quot; give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime .
&quot; false hopes can never be a solution .

human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
following initial infection , a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness .
typically , this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms .
as the infection progresses , it interferes more with the immune system , increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis , as well as other opportunistic infections , and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems .
in 2015 about 36 .
symptoms occur in 40 – 90 % of cases and most commonly include fever , large tender lymph nodes , throat inflammation , a rash , headache , and / or sores of the mouth and genitals .
the rash , which occurs in 20 – 50 % of cases , presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular , classically .
some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage .
these individuals are classified as HIV controllers or long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) .
both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 .
cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus ( HPV ) .
08 % per act for male-to-female transmission .

in 2008 in the United States approximately 1 .
the worst affected European countries , in 2009 and 2012 estimates , are Russia , Ukraine , Latvia , Moldova , Portugal and Belarus , in decreasing order of prevalence .
AIDS was first clinically observed in 1981 in the United States .
the initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and homosexual men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) , a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems .
soon thereafter , an unexpected number of homosexual men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma ( KS ) .

adamant and similar words are used to refer to any especially hard substance , whether composed of diamond , some other gemstone , or some type of metal .
both adamant and diamond derive from the Greek word ἀδάμας , ἀδάμαντος ( adamas , adamantos ) , meaning &quot; untameable &quot; .
Virgil describes Tartarus as having a screeching gate protected by columns of solid adamantine ( Aeneid book VI ) .
later , by the Middle Ages , the term came to refer to diamond , as it was the hardest material then known , and remains the hardest non-synthetic material known .
it was in the Middle Ages , too , that adamantine hardness and the lodestone &apos;s magnetic properties became confused and combined , leading to an alternate definition in which &quot; adamant &quot; means magnet , falsely derived from the Latin adamare , which means to love or be attached to .
another connection was the belief that adamant ( the diamond definition ) could block the effects of a magnet .
this was addressed in chapter III of Pseudodoxia Epidemica , for instance .
since the word diamond is now used for the hardest gemstone , the increasingly archaic term &quot; adamant &quot; has a mostly poetic or figurative use .
in that capacity , the name is frequently used in popular media and fiction to refer to a very hard substance .

when Hitler was three , the family moved to Passau , Germany .
on 21 December 1907 , his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47 .
historian Richard J.
&#91; B &#93; In the following days , Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser , to thunderous applause .
his strategy proved successful , and at a special party congress on 29 July , he was granted absolute powers as party chairman , replacing Drexler , by a vote of 533 to 1 .
some passages implied genocide .
its leader , chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party , governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg .
the NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18 .
Hitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers , Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hans Ludin , in late 1930 .
both were charged with membership in the NSDAP , at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel .
Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression , such as farmers , war veterans , and the middle class .
Hitler ran against Hindenburg in the 1932 presidential elections .
Hitler used the campaign slogan &quot; Hitler über Deutschland &quot; ( &quot; Hitler over Germany &quot; ) , a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft .
Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election , garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election .
although he lost to Hindenburg , this election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics .
as chancellor , Hitler worked against attempts by the NSDAP &apos;s opponents to build a majority government .
activities of the German Communist Party ( KPD ) were suppressed , and some 4,000 KPD members were arrested .
on 21 March 1933 , the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam .
Hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg .
to achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament , Hitler &apos;s government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz ( Enabling Act ) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag .
on 14 July 1933 , the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany .
the demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military , industrial , and political leaders .
on 2 August 1934 , Hindenburg died .
unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936 .
Hitler found Bülow &apos;s goals to be too modest .
Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933 .
France and Italy were not consulted before the signing , directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance .
Germany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936 , in violation of the Versailles Treaty .
Hitler also sent troops to Spain to support General Franco during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936 .
at the same time , Hitler continued his efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance .
in August 1936 , in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts , Hitler ordered Göring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years .
the plan envisaged an all-out struggle between &quot; Judeo-Bolshevism &quot; and German national socialism , which in Hitler &apos;s view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs .
count Galeazzo Ciano , foreign minister of Mussolini &apos;s government , declared an axis between Germany and Italy , and on 25 November , Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan .
on 3 April , Hitler ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss ( &quot; Case White &quot; ) , the plan for invading Poland on 25 August .
accordingly , on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland .
this plan required tacit Soviet support , and the non-aggression pact ( the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact ) between Germany and the Soviet Union , led by Joseph Stalin , included a secret agreement to partition Poland between the two countries .
contrary to Ribbentrop &apos;s prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties , Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939 .
this , along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel , prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September .
Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August ; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction .
the records of the Wannsee Conference , held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich , with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating , provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust .
on 22 February , Hitler was recorded saying , &quot; we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews &quot; .
the Nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene .
Hitler ruled the NSDAP autocratically by asserting the Führerprinzip ( leader principle ) .
he regularly consumed amphetamine , barbiturates , opiates , and cocaine .

in Greek mythology , Aeson ( Greek : Αἴσων Aísōn ) was the son of Cretheus and Tyro .
he had two other brothers Pheres and Amythaon .
Aeson was the father of Jason and Promachus with Polymele , the daughter of Autolycus .
other sources say the mother of his children was Alcimede or Amphinome .
Aeson &apos;s mother Tyro had two other sons , Neleus and Pelias , with the sea god Poseidon .
Pelias was power-hungry and he wished to gain dominion over all of Thessaly .
to this end , he banished Neleus and Pheres and locked Aeson in the dungeons in Iolcus .
Aeson sent Jason to Chiron to be educated while Pelias , afraid that he would be overthrown , was warned by an oracle to beware of a man wearing one sandal .
many years later , Pelias was holding the Olympics in honor of Poseidon when Jason , rushing to Iolcus , lost one of his sandals in a river while helping Hera ( Juno ) , in the form of an old woman , cross .
when Jason entered Iolcus , he was announced as a man wearing one sandal .
suspicious , Pelias asked him what he ( Jason ) would do if confronted with the man who would be his downfall .
Jason responded that he would send that man after the Golden Fleece .
Pelias took that advice and sent Jason to retrieve the Golden Fleece .
during Jason &apos;s absence , Pelias intended to kill Aeson .
however , Aeson committed suicide by drinking bull &apos;s blood .
his wife killed herself as well , and Pelias murdered their infant son Promachus .
alternatively , he survived until Jason and his new wife , Medea , came back to Iolcus .
she slit Aeson &apos;s throat , then put his corpse in a pot and Aeson came to life as a young man .
she then told Pelias &apos; daughters she would do the same for their father .
they slit his throat and Medea refused to raise him , so Pelias stayed dead .

an amyl alcohol is any of 8 alcohols with the formula C5H11OH .
three of these alcohols , active amyl alcohol ( 2-methylbutan-1-ol ) , methyl ( n ) propyl carbinol ( pentan-2-ol ) , and methyl isopropyl carbinol ( 3-methylbutan-2-ol ) , contain an asymmetric carbon atom and are therefore optically active .
the most important is isobutyl carbinol , the chief constituent of fermentation amyl alcohol and a constituent of fusel oil .
it can be separated from fusel oil by either of two methods : shaking with strong brine solution and separating the oily layer from the brine layer ; distilling it and collecting the fraction that boils between 125 and 140 ° C.
further purification is possible with this procedure : shaking the product with hot limewater , separating the oily layer , drying the product with calcium chloride , and distilling it , collecting the fraction boiling between 128 and 132 ° C.
isobutyl carbinol can be synthesized from isobutanol by conversion into isovaleraldehyde , which is subsequently reduced to isobutyl carbinol by means of sodium amalgam .
it is a colourless liquid of density 0 .
8247 g / cm ³ ( 0 ° C ) , boiling at 131 .
6 ° C , slightly soluble in water , and easily dissolved in organic solvents .
it has a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste .
amyl alcohol has an oral LD50 of 200 mg / kg in mice , suggesting that it is significantly more toxic than ethanol .
on passing the vapour through a red-hot tube , it decomposes into acetylene , ethylene , propylene , and other compounds .
it is oxidized by chromic acid to isovaleraldehyde , and it forms addition compounds crystals with calcium chloride and tin ( IV ) chloride .
the other amyl alcohols may be obtained synthetically .
of these , tertiary butyl carbinol has been the most difficult to obtain , with the first reported synthesis in 1891 by L.
Tissier using the reduction of a mixture of trimethyl acetic acid and trimethylacetyl chloride with sodium amalgam .
it became the official national anthem in 1847 .

these chromosomes are referred to as homologous chromosomes .
this type of interaction was first formally described by Gregor Mendel .
however , many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by co-dominance and polygenic inheritance .
the frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes ( see Hardy-Weinberg principle ) .
for a simple model , with two alleles : .
where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the alternative allele , which necessarily sum to unity .
then , p2 is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele , 2pq is the fraction of heterozygotes , and q2 is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele .
if the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is p2 + 2pq , and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is q2 .
with three alleles : .
examples include red-green color blindness and fragile X syndrome .
other disorders , such as Huntington disease , occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele .

outcomes are usually good .
internal and external hemorrhoids may present differently ; however , many people may have a combination of the two .
however , when thrombosed , hemorrhoids may be very painful .
other factors believed to increase risk include obesity , prolonged sitting , a chronic cough , and pelvic floor dysfunction .
evidence for these associations , however , is poor .
during pregnancy , pressure from the fetus on the abdomen and hormonal changes cause the hemorrhoidal vessels to enlarge .
the birth of the baby also leads to increased intra-abdominal pressures .
pregnant women rarely need surgical treatment , as symptoms usually resolve after delivery .
hemorrhoid cushions are a part of normal human anatomy and become a pathological disease only when they experience abnormal changes .
there are three main cushions present in the normal anal canal .
these are located classically at left lateral , right anterior , and right posterior positions .
they are composed of neither arteries nor veins , but blood vessels called sinusoids , connective tissue , and smooth muscle .
: 175 Sinusoids do not have muscle tissue in their walls , as veins do .
this set of blood vessels is known as the hemorrhoidal plexus .
hemorrhoid cushions are important for continence .
they contribute to 15 – 20 % of anal closure pressure at rest and protect the internal and external anal sphincter muscles during the passage of stool .
when a person bears down , the intra-abdominal pressure grows , and hemorrhoid cushions increase in size , helping maintain anal closure .
hemorrhoid symptoms are believed to result when these vascular structures slide downwards or when venous pressure is excessively increased .
increased internal and external anal sphincter pressure may also be involved in hemorrhoid symptoms .
two types of hemorrhoids occur : internals from the superior hemorrhoidal plexus and externals from the inferior hemorrhoidal plexus .
the dentate line divides the two regions .
hemorrhoids are typically diagnosed by physical examination .
a visual examination of the anus and surrounding area may diagnose external or prolapsed hemorrhoids .
a rectal exam may be performed to detect possible rectal tumors , polyps , an enlarged prostate , or abscesses .
this examination may not be possible without appropriate sedation because of pain , although most internal hemorrhoids are not associated with pain .
visual confirmation of internal hemorrhoids may require anoscopy , insertion of a hollow tube device with a light attached at one end .
the two types of hemorrhoids are external and internal .
these are differentiated by their position with respect to the dentate line .
some persons may concurrently have symptomatic versions of both .
if pain is present , the condition is more likely to be an anal fissure or an external hemorrhoid rather than an internal hemorrhoid .
internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line .
they are covered by columnar epithelium , which lacks pain receptors .
they were classified in 1985 into four grades based on the degree of prolapse : .
external hemorrhoids occur below the dentate or pectinate line .
they are covered proximally by anoderm and distally by skin , both of which are sensitive to pain and temperature .
many anorectal problems , including fissures , fistulae , abscesses , colorectal cancer , rectal varices , and itching have similar symptoms and may be incorrectly referred to as hemorrhoids .
rectal bleeding may also occur owing to colorectal cancer , colitis including inflammatory bowel disease , diverticular disease , and angiodysplasia .
if anemia is present , other potential causes should be considered .
spending less time attempting to defecate , avoiding reading while on the toilet , and losing weight for overweight persons and avoiding heavy lifting are also recommended .
conservative treatment typically consists of foods rich in dietary fiber , intake of oral fluids to maintain hydration , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , sitz baths , and rest .
increased fiber intake has been shown to improve outcomes and may be achieved by dietary alterations or the consumption of fiber supplements .
evidence for benefits from sitz baths during any point in treatment , however , is lacking .
most agents include a combination of active ingredients .
symptoms usually resolve following pregnancy ; thus active treatment is often delayed until after delivery .
a number of office-based procedures may be performed .
while generally safe , rare serious side effects such as perianal sepsis may occur .
also , a small risk of fecal incontinence occurs , particularly of liquid , with rates reported between 0 % and 28 % .
mucosal ectropion is another condition which may occur after hemorrhoidectomy ( often together with anal stenosis ) .
however , symptomatic hemorrhoids are thought to affect at least 50 % of the US population at some time during their lives , and around 5 % of the population is affected at any given time .
both sexes experience about the same incidence of the condition , with rates peaking between 45 and 65 years .
only a small proportion of persons end up needing surgery .
the first known mention of this disease is from a 1700 BC Egyptian papyrus , which advises : “ .
Celsus ( 25 BC – AD 14 ) described ligation and excision procedures , and discussed the possible complications .
the first use of the word &quot; hemorrhoid &quot; in English occurs in 1398 , derived from the Old French &quot; emorroides &quot; , from Latin hæmorrhoida , in turn from the Greek αἱμορροΐς ( haimorrhois ) , &quot; liable to discharge blood &quot; , from αἷμα ( haima ) , &quot; blood &quot; and ῥόος ( rhoos ) , &quot; stream , flow , current &quot; , itself from ῥέω ( rheo ) , &quot; to flow , to stream &quot; .
Hall-of-Fame baseball player George Brett was removed from a game in the 1980 World Series due to hemorrhoid pain .
after undergoing minor surgery , Brett returned to play in the next game , quipping &quot; .
&quot; Brett underwent further hemorrhoid surgery the following spring .

Spain introduced many words and added / e / and / o / in the long run .
however , even in modern times , / i / and / e / , and / u / and / o / are still interchangeable ( eg .
&quot; Pangit &quot; , &quot; panget &quot; ) , and when stressed , / e / and / o / are sometimes even diphthonized to / ai / and / au / .

hypertension ( HTN or HT ) , also known as high blood pressure ( HBP ) , is a long term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated .
high blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms .
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over 12 to 24 hours is the most accurate method to confirm the diagnosis .
an exception to this is those with very high blood pressure readings especially when there is poor organ function .
initial assessment of the hypertensive people should include a complete history and physical examination .
serum creatinine is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease , which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension .
most people require more than one medication to control their hypertension .
4 % ( men ) and 6 .
8 % ( women ) in rural India and as high as 68 .
9 % ( men ) and 72 .
5 % ( women ) in Poland .
African American adults in the United States have among the highest rates of hypertension in the world at 44 % .
it is also more common in Filipino Americans and less common in US whites and Mexican Americans .
the English clergyman Stephen Hales made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733 .
descriptions of hypertension as a disease came among others from Thomas Young in 1808 and especially Richard Bright in 1836 .
the first report of elevated blood pressure in a person without evidence of kidney disease was made by Frederick Akbar Mahomed ( 1849 – 1884 ) .
the first chemical for hypertension , sodium thiocyanate , was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular .
the first was chlorothiazide , the first thiazide diuretic and developed from the antibiotic sulfanilamide , which became available in 1958 .
the World Hypertension League ( WHL ) , an umbrella organization of 85 national hypertension societies and leagues , recognized that more than 50 % of the hypertensive population worldwide are unaware of their condition .
to address this problem , the WHL initiated a global awareness campaign on hypertension in 2005 and dedicated May 17 of each year as World Hypertension Day ( WHD ) .
over the past three years , more national societies have been engaging in WHD and have been innovative in their activities to get the message to the public .
in 2007 , there was record participation from 47 member countries of the WHL .
during the week of WHD , all these countries – in partnership with their local governments , professional societies , nongovernmental organizations and private industries – promoted hypertension awareness among the public through several media and public rallies .
using mass media such as Internet and television , the message reached more than 250 million people .
as the momentum picks up year after year , the WHL is confident that almost all the estimated 1 .
5 billion people affected by elevated blood pressure can be reached .
high blood pressure is the most common chronic medical problem prompting visits to primary health care providers in USA .
the American Heart Association estimated the direct and indirect costs of high blood pressure in 2010 as $ 76 .
6 billion .
adequate management of hypertension can be hampered by inadequacies in the diagnosis , treatment , or control of high blood pressure .

following the death of Darius , Amyrtaeus declared himself king in 404 BC .
Amytis and her mother are portrayed in Ctesias &apos; account as the most powerful women during Artaxerxes &apos; reign .
near 445 BC , her husband Megabyzus started a successful revolt in Syria against Artaxerxes I.
initially , Amytis stayed with the king during the war ; however , she later participated , along with Amestris and the satrap Artarius , in the reconciliation negotiations between the rebel and the king .
notwithstanding this , Megabyzus again fell in disgrace and was expelled from the court and exiled to a town on the Persian Gulf .
after five years in exile , Megabyzus was forgiven and allowed to return to the court , again thanks to the intercession of Amytis and Amestris .
Amytis bore Megabyzus two sons : Zopyrus and Artyphius .
after the death of his father and mother , Zopyrus fled to Athens , where , according to Ctesias , he &quot; was well received owing to the services his mother had rendered to the Athenians &quot; .
Greek sources portray Amytis as a licentious woman .
according to Ctesias , during Xerxes &apos; reign she was accused of adultery by Megabyzus .
the same historian further affirms that , after her husband &apos;s death , she had a love affair with the Greek physician Apollonides of Cos , and that when the affair was discovered , Apollonides was tortured and put to death by queen mother Amestris .
Dinon , another Greek historian , describes Amytis as the most beautiful and licentious woman of Asia .
the most difficult challenge in using historians as Ctesias or Dinon as reliable sources is the fact that they tended to write amazing stories that would better appeal to their readers , often without much attention to historical rigor .
the lack of primary sources makes it therefore impossible to have an accurate image of Amytis .

René d &apos;Herblay , alias Aramis , is a fictional character in the novels The Three Musketeers , Twenty Years After and The Vicomte de Bragelonne by Alexandre Dumas , père .
he and the other two musketeers , Athos and Porthos , are friends of the novels &apos; protagonist , d &apos;Artagnan .
the fictional Aramis is loosely based on the historical musketeer Henri d &apos;Aramitz .
Aramis loves and courts women , which fits well with the opinions of the time regarding Jesuits and abbots .
he is portrayed as constantly ambitious and unsatisfied : as a musketeer , he yearns to become an abbé ; but when an abbé he wishes for the life of the soldier .
in the books it is revealed he became a musketeer because of a woman and his arrogance : as a young man whose ambition was to become an abbé , he had the misfortune to be caught and thrown out of a house , while ( innocently or not ) reading to a young woman .
for a year , he practiced fencing , every day with the best master swordsman in town to get his revenge .
by the time he came back to confront the man who had mistreated him , he had become such an expert swordsman that the fight only lasted a couple of seconds .
because duels were forbidden by royal edict and Aramis was a novice , he had to disappear and adopt a very low profile , which led him to enlist in the Musketeers Corps .
there he met Athos and Porthos , and later d &apos;Artagnan .
in Twenty Years After , he followed Athos &apos;s pleas to spare Mordaunt , while he was holding him at gunpoint and , in Le Vicomte De Bragelonne , he refused to suppress d &apos;Artagnan , when he discovered the truth about Belle-Ile-En-Mer .
Aramis even tells Porthos the true identity of the man in the iron mask , despite fearing that Porthos would kill the man .
in contrast to the other musketeers , Aramis is referred to by his first name twice by Dumas : he is christened René .
in Twenty Years After he is a Jesuit known as the Abbé d &apos;Herblay ( but prefers to go by the title of Chevalier d &apos;Herblay ) .
in The Vicomte de Bragelonne he is the Bishop of Vannes , a title given to him by Nicolas Fouquet and later he became the Superior General of the Jesuits .

general Arcadio Maxilom y Molero ( November 13 , 1862 – August 10 , 1924 ) was a Filipino teacher and hero of the Philippine Revolution .
he was born in Tuburan , Cebu to Roberto Maxilom , the town gobernadorcillo , and Gregoria Molero .
his family were members of the local gentry , or principalía .
he worked as a teacher in the local school before joining the Katipunan , whose activities in Cebu were led by a young Negrense , León Kilat .
after Kilat &apos;s betrayal and assassination , Maxilom continued the revolution in Cebu .
under his command , the Katipunan was able to regroup in the central highlands , which Spanish forces found impenetrable .
on December 16 , 1898 , Maxilom wrote a letter to the Spanish authorities in Cebu , demanding that the latter surrender .
weary after incessant fighting , the Spaniards quickly responded , asking Maxilom for two to three days to leave the province .
by Christmas Eve , the Spaniards had left , leaving behind only three Catholic clerics .
little did the Cebuanos , indeed , all Filipinos , know that their newfound liberty would be short-lived , Spain having already been forced to sell the fate of their former subjects to the United States for twenty million dollars ( see Treaty of Paris ) .
Maxilom is best remembered for stubbornly refusing to surrender to the American occupying forces even as his fellow revolutionaries in Manila and Cebu were starting to capitulate or collaborate with the new colonial power .
he finally surrendered on October 27 , 1901 .
virtually forgotten after the revolution , Maxilom died in his hometown of Tuburan , after a long bout with paralysis , on August 10 , 1924 .
his funeral cortège , joined in by leading revolutionary figures including Emilio Aguinaldo , stretched some four kilometers , in what remains to this day the longest in Cebu &apos;s history .
mango Avenue , one of main thoroughfares Cebu City , was renamed Maxilom Avenue in honor of the general .

Fuentebella ( born October 29 , 1945 ) was the Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives from 2000 to 2001 .
he is a former representative of the Third ( now Fourth ) District of Camarines Sur , more popularly known as the Partido District .
Arnulfo &quot; Noli &quot; Fuentebella was born in October 29 , 1945 in Camarines Sur to former Representative and Governor Felix A.
Fuentebella and Rita Palma .
he was educated in his home province and spent most of his life in scouting until he reached Life Scout .
at the age of 15 , Fuentebella was a Philippine delegate to the 50th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America in 1960 .
but after President Ferdinand E.
Marcos imposed martial rule and called for elections to the Interim Batasang Pambansa ( IBP ) , Fuentebella was chosen by the President to run in Congress to represent Partido .
he subsequently won the elections and served as an assemblyman in the IBP from 1978 to 1984 .
however , he lost his bid for a seat in the 1984 Regular Batasang Pambansa and used the hiatus to practice law in New York , where he was admitted to the State Bar .
then the EDSA Revolution happened and President Marcos fled into exile .
as the Fuentebellas had been identified with the Marcoses , hropted to sit out the Cory Aquino years .
in 1992 , political allies asked Fuentebella to run again in Congress .
he won three consecutive terms as Congressman ( 1992-2001 ) .
after then Speaker Manuel Villar , Jr .
passed President Joseph Estrada &apos;s Articles of Impeachment to the Senate , Fuentebella was elected Speaker after Estrada &apos;s allies in the House of Representatives motioned to make all positions in the House vacant ; Fuentebella won the nomination .
on January 20 , 2001 , during the EDSA Revolution of 2001 , Estrada left the Malacañan Palace and Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was sworn to the presidency at the EDSA Shrine by Chief Justice Hilario Davide , Jr .
accompanying Davide were the chairs of the two houses of Congress , Senate President Aquilino Pimentel , Jr .
and Speaker Fuentebella .
four days later , on January 24 , the Arroyo allies mustered enough votes to unseat Fuentebella , replacing him with Quezon City representative Feliciano Belmonte .
when Fuentebella had served the maximum three consecutive terms as a congressman , his son Felix William / Wimpy took over for one term ( 2001-2004 ) .
he ran again for Congress and won three more consecutive terms ( 2004-2013 ) .

Arthur &quot; Art &quot; Tatum , Jr .
( / ˈteɪtəm / , October 13 , 1909 – November 5 , 1956 ) was an American jazz pianist .
critic Scott Yanow wrote , &quot; Tatum &apos;s quick reflexes and boundless imagination kept his improvisations filled with fresh ( and sometimes futuristic ) ideas that put him way ahead of his contemporaries .
only one full-length biography has been published , Too Marvelous for Words ( 1994 ) , by James Lester .
Lester interviewed many of Tatum &apos;s contemporaries for the book and drew from many articles published about him .
Tatum was born in Toledo , Ohio .
his father , Arthur Tatum , Sr.
, was a guitarist and an elder at Grace Presbyterian Church , where his mother , Mildred Hoskins , played piano .
he had two siblings , Karl and Arlene .
from infancy he suffered from cataracts ( of disputed cause ) which left him blind in one eye and with only very limited vision in the other .
a number of surgical procedures improved his eye condition to a degree but some of the benefits were reversed when he was assaulted in 1930 .
a child with perfect pitch , Tatum learned to play by ear , picking out church hymns by the age of three , learning tunes from the radio and copying piano roll recordings his mother owned .
in a Voice of America interview , he denied the widespread rumor that he learned to play by copying piano roll recordings made by two pianists .
he developed a very fast playing style , without losing accuracy .
as a child he was also very sensitive to the piano &apos;s intonation and insisted it be tuned often .
while playing piano was the most obvious application of his mental and physical skills , he also had an encyclopedic memory for Major League Baseball statistics .
in 1925 , Tatum moved to the Columbus School for the Blind , where he studied music and learned braille .
he subsequently studied piano with Overton G.
Rainey at either the Jefferson School or the Toledo School of Music .
in 1927 , Tatum began playing on Toledo radio station WSPD as &apos; Arthur Tatum , Toledo &apos;s Blind Pianist &apos; , during interludes in Ellen Kay &apos;s shopping chat program and soon had his own program .
by the age of 19 , Tatum was playing at the local Waiters &apos; and Bellmens &apos; Club .
Tatum drew inspiration from the pianists James P.
Johnson and Fats Waller , who exemplified the stride piano style , and from the more &quot; modern &quot; Earl Hines , six years Tatum &apos;s senior .
he used to buy all of Earl &apos;s records and would improvise on them .
he &apos;d play the record but he &apos;d improvise over what Earl was doing .
&apos;course , when you heard Art play you didn &apos;t hear nothing of anybody but Art .
but he got his ideas from Earl &apos;s style of playing – but Earl never knew that .
&quot; Tatum &apos;s debut was historic because he outplayed the elite competition and heralded the demise of the stride era .
he was not challenged further until stride specialist Donald Lambert initiated a half-serious rivalry with him .
Tatum returned to Ohio and played around the American midwest – Toledo , Cleveland , Detroit , Saint Louis and Chicago – in the mid-1930s and played on the Fleischman Hour radio program hosted by Rudy Vallee in 1935 .
he also played stints at the Three Deuces in Chicago and in Los Angeles played at the Trocadero , the Paramount and the Club Alabam .
in 1937 , he returned to New York , where he appeared at clubs and played on national radio programs .
the following year he embarked on the Queen Mary for England where he toured , playing for three months at Ciro &apos;s Club owned by bandleader Ambrose .
in the late 1930s , he returned to play and record in Los Angeles and New York .
in 1941 , Tatum recorded two sessions for Decca Records with singer Big Joe Turner , the first of which included &quot; Wee Wee Baby Blues &quot; , which attained national popularity .
two years later Tatum won Esquire magazine &apos;s first jazz popularity poll .
Grimes abandoned the group , but Tatum continually returned to this format .
art Tatum died on November 5 , 1956 , at Queen of Angels Medical Center in Los Angeles , from complications of uremia ( as a result of kidney failure ) .
Geraldine died on May 4 , 2010 , in Los Angeles , and was interred beside Art at Forest Lawn Cemetery .
Tatum built upon stride and classical piano influences to develop a novel and unique piano style .
he introduced a strong , swinging pulse to jazz piano , highlighted with cadenzas that swept across the entire keyboard .
his interpretations of popular songs were exuberant , sophisticated and intricate .
but jazz musicians were beginning to incorporate improvisation while playing over the chord changes of tunes , and Tatum was a leader in that movement .
he sometimes improvised lines that presaged bebop and later jazz genres , although generally not venturing far from the original melodic line .
Tatum embellished melodic lines , however , with an array of signature devices and runs that appeared throughout his repertoire .
Tatum &apos;s sound was attributable to both his harmonic inventiveness and technical prowess .
many of his harmonic concepts and larger chord voicings ( e .
he worked some of the upper extensions of chords into his lines , a practice which was further developed by Bud Powell and Charlie Parker , which in turn was an influence on the development of &apos; modern jazz &apos; .
Tatum also pioneered the use of dissonance in jazz piano , as can be heard , for example , on his recording of &quot; Aunt Hagar &apos;s Blues &quot; , which uses extensive dissonance to achieve a bluesy effect .
in addition to using major and minor seconds , dissonance was inherent in the complex chords that Tatum frequently used .
Tatum could also play the blues with authority .
pianist Jay McShann , not known for showering compliments on his rivals , said &quot; Art could really play the blues .
to me , he was the world &apos;s greatest blues player , and I think few people realized that .
Benny Green wrote in his collected work of essays , The Reluctant Art , that &quot; Tatum has been the only jazz musician to date who has made an attempt to conceive a style based upon all styles , to master the mannerisms of all schools and then synthesize those into something personal .
&quot; he was playful , spontaneous and often inserted quotes from other songs into his improvisations .
Tatum was not inclined toward understatement or expansive use of space .
he seldom played in a simplified way , preferring interpretations that displayed his great technique and clever harmonizations .
when jazz pianist Stanley Cowell was growing up in Toledo , his father prevailed upon Tatum to play piano at the Cowell home .
Stanley described the scene as , &quot; Tatum played so brilliantly and so much .
that I thought the piano was gonna break .
my mother left the room .
so I said &apos; What &apos;s wrong , Mama ? &apos; and she said &apos; Oh , that man plays too much piano .
&apos; &quot; a handful of critics , notably Keith Jarrett , have complained that Tatum played too many notes or was too ornamental or was even &apos; unjazzlike &apos; .
jazz critic Gary Giddins opined , &quot; That is the essence of Tatum .
if you don &apos;t like his ornament , you should be listening to someone else .
his innovations were to greatly influence later jazz pianists , such as Powell , Thelonious Monk , Oscar Peterson , Billy Taylor , Bill Evans , Tete Montoliu and Chick Corea .
one of Tatum &apos;s innovations was his extensive use of the pentatonic scale , which may have inspired later pianists to further mine its possibilities as a device for soloing .
Herbie Hancock described Tatum &apos;s unique tone as &quot; majestic &quot; and devoted some time to unlocking this sound and to noting Tatum &apos;s harmonic arsenal .
the sounds that Tatum produced with the piano were also distinctive .
generally playing at mezzoforte volume , he employed the entire keyboard from deep bass tones to sonorous mid-register chords to sparkling upper register runs .
he used the sustain pedal sparingly so that each note was clearly articulated , chords were cleanly sounded and the melodic line would not be blurred .
critic Gunther Schuller declared , &quot; On one point there is universal agreement : Tatum &apos;s awesome technique .
&quot; that technique was marked by a calm physical demeanor and efficiency .
Tatum did not indulge in theatrical physical or facial expression .
the effortless gliding of his hands over difficult passages baffled most who witnessed the phenomenon .
he especially astonished other pianists to whom Tatum appeared to be &quot; playing the impossible .
&quot; even when playing scintillating runs at high velocity , it appeared that his fingers hardly moved .
it was deceptive .
you &apos;d watch him and you couldn &apos;t believe what was coming out , what was reaching your ears .
he didn &apos;t have that much motion at the piano .
he didn ’ t make a big show of moving around and waving his hands and going through all sorts of physical gyrations to produce the music that he produced , so that in itself is amazing .
there had to be intense concentration there , but you couldn ’ t tell by just looking at him play .
using self-taught fingering , including an array of two-fingered runs , he executed the pyrotechnics with meticulous accuracy and timing .
his execution was all the more remarkable considering that he drank prodigious amounts of alcohol when performing , yet his recordings are never sloppy .
Tatum also displayed phenomenal independence of the hands and ambidexterity , which was particularly evident while improvising counterpoint .
jazz historian and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum &apos;s &quot; left hand was the equal of his right .
anytime you &apos;re ready .
&quot; Tatum laughed and replied , &quot; Look , you come in here tomorrow , and anything you do with your right hand , I &apos;ll do with my left .
&quot; Powell never took up the challenge .
Tatum played chords with a relatively flat-fingered technique compared to the curvature taught in classical training .
composer / pianist Mary Lou Williams told Whitney Balliett , &quot; Tatum taught me how to hit my notes , how to control them without using pedals .
and he showed me how to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone .
&quot; Jimmy Rowles said , &quot; Most of the stuff he played was clear over my head .
there was too much going on — both hands were impossible to believe .
you couldn &apos;t pick out what he was doing because his fingers were so smooth and soft , and the way he did it — it was like camouflage .
&quot; when his fastest tracks of &quot; Tiger Rag &quot; are slowed down , they still reveal a coherent , syncopated rhythm .
after regular club dates , Tatum would decamp to after-hours clubs to hang out with other musicians who would play for each other .
biographer James Lester notes that Tatum enjoyed listening to other pianists and preferred to play last when several pianists played .
he frequently played for hours on end into the dawn , to the detriment of his marriages .
Tatum was said to be more spontaneous and creative in those free-form nocturnal sessions than in his scheduled performances .
evidence of this can be found in the set entitled 20th Century Piano Genius which consists of 40 tunes recorded at private parties at the home of Hollywood music director Ray Heindorf in 1950 and 1955 .
according to the review by Marc Greilsamer , &quot; All of the trademark Tatum elements are here : the grand melodic flourishes , the harmonic magic tricks , the flirtations with various tempos and musical styles .
but what also emerges is Tatum &apos;s effervescence , his joy , and his humor .
he seems to celebrate and mock these timeless melodies all at once .
Tatum tended to work and to record unaccompanied , partly because relatively few musicians could keep pace with his fast tempos and advanced harmonic vocabulary .
other musicians expressed amazed bewilderment at performing with Tatum .
drummer Jo Jones , who recorded a 1956 trio session with Tatum and bassist Red Callender , is quoted as quipping , &quot; I didn &apos;t even play on that session &#91; .
&#93; all I did was listen .
I mean , what could I add ? &#91; .
&#93; I felt like setting my damn drums on fire .
&quot; clarinetist Buddy DeFranco said that playing with Tatum was &quot; like chasing a train .
&quot; Tatum said of himself , &quot; A band hampers me .
Tatum did not readily adapt or defer to other musicians in ensemble settings .
early in his career he was required to restrain himself when he worked as accompanist for vocalist Adelaide Hall in 1932 – 33 .
he later recorded with other musicians , including a notable session with the 1944 Esquire Jazz All-Stars , which included Louis Armstrong , Billie Holiday and other jazz greats , at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City .
Tatum &apos;s repertoire mainly consisted of music from the Great American Songbook — Tin Pan Alley , Broadway and other popular music of the 1920s , 1930s and 1940s .
he played his own arrangements of a few classical piano pieces as well , most famously Dvořák &apos;s Humoresque No .
7 and Massenet &apos;s &quot; Élégie &quot; .
mainstream jazz piano has gone in a different direction from that pioneered by Tatum .
nevertheless , transcriptions of Tatum are popular and are often practiced assiduously .
although Bud Powell was of the bebop movement , his prolific and exciting style showed Tatum influence .
Tatum recorded commercially from 1932 until near his death .
although recording opportunities were somewhat intermittent for most of his career due to his solo style , he left copious recordings .
he recorded for Brunswick ( 1933 ) , Decca ( 1934 – 41 ) , Capitol ( 1949 , 1952 ) and for the labels associated with Norman Granz ( 1953 – 56 ) .
Tatum demonstrated remarkable memory when he recorded 68 solo tracks for Granz in two days , all but three of the tracks in one take .
he also recorded a series of group recordings for Granz with , among others , Ben Webster , Jo Jones , Buddy DeFranco , Benny Carter , Harry Sweets Edison , Roy Eldridge and Lionel Hampton .
although only a small amount of film showing Tatum playing exists today , several minutes of professionally shot archival footage can be found in Martin Scorsese &apos;s documentary The Blues .
footage also appears in Ken Burns &apos; documentary Jazz , which includes a short passage on Tatum &apos;s life and work , including comments from Jimmy Rowles and Gary Giddins .
Tatum appeared in the 1947 movie The Fabulous Dorseys , first playing a solo and then accompanying Dorsey &apos;s band in an impromptu song .
Tatum appeared on Steve Allen &apos;s Tonight Show in the early 1950s , and on other television shows from this era .
however , all of the kinescopes of the Allen shows , which were stored in a warehouse along with other now defunct shows , were thrown into a local rubbish dump to make room for new studios .
however , the soundtracks were recorded off-air by Tatum enthusiasts at the time , and many are included in Storyville Records &apos; extensive series of rare Tatum recordings .
on the recommendation of Oscar Peterson , Tatum was portrayed by Johnny O &apos;Neal in Ray , a 2004 biopic about R &amp; B artist Ray Charles .
he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989 .
numerous stories exist about other musicians &apos; respect for Tatum .
perhaps the most famous is the story about the time Tatum walked into a club where Fats Waller was playing , and Waller stepped away from the piano bench to make way for Tatum , announcing , &quot; I only play the piano , but tonight God is in the house .
&quot; fats Waller &apos;s son confirmed the statement .
Charlie Parker ( who helped develop bebop ) was highly influenced by Tatum .
when newly arrived in New York , Parker briefly worked as a dishwasher in a Manhattan restaurant where Tatum was performing and often listened to the pianist .
Parker once said , &quot; I wish I could play like Tatum &apos;s right hand ! &quot; .
when Oscar Peterson was still a boy , his father played him a recording of Tatum performing &quot; Tiger Rag &quot; .
once the young Peterson was finally persuaded that it was performed by a single person , he was so intimidated that he did not touch the piano for weeks .
Peterson also stated that , &quot; If you speak of pianists , the most complete pianist that we have known and possibly will know , from what I &apos;ve heard to date , is Art Tatum .
&quot; &quot; musically speaking , he was and is my musical God , and I feel honored to remain one of his humbly devoted disciples .
&quot; here &apos;s something new .
count Basie called him the eighth wonder of the world .
Dave Brubeck observed , &quot; I don &apos;t think there &apos;s any more chance of another Tatum turning up than another Mozart .
&quot; pianist Mulgrew Miller , commented on personal growth by saying , &quot; When I talk to the people I admire , they &apos;re always talking about continuous growth and development and I look at them and say , &apos; Well .
what are YOU going to do ? &apos; but , as Harold Mabern says , &apos; There &apos;s always Art Tatum records around &apos; &quot; .
Dizzy Gillespie said , &quot; First you speak of Art Tatum , then take a long deep breath , and you speak of the other pianists .
the pianist Teddy Wilson observed , &quot; Maybe this will explain Art Tatum .
if you put a piano in a room , just a bare piano .
then you get all the finest jazz pianists in the world and let them play in the presence of Art Tatum .
then let Art Tatum play .
everyone there will sound like an amateur .
other music luminaries of the day , including Vladimir Horowitz , Arthur Rubinstein , Sergei Rachmaninoff , Leopold Godowsky , David Oistrakh and George Gershwin marveled at Tatum &apos;s genius .
jazz critic Leonard Feather called Tatum &quot; the greatest soloist in jazz history , regardless of instrument .
for his 2008 album Act Your Age , Gordon Goodwin wrote a new big band arrangement to accompany Zenph &apos;s re-performance of &quot; Yesterdays &quot; , and the track was recognized with a Grammy Nomination for Best Instrumental Arrangement .
Tatum recorded commercially from 1932 until near his death .
although recording opportunities were somewhat intermittent for most of his career due to his solo style , he left copious recordings .
he recorded for Decca ( 1934 – 41 ) .

in Manga : the Complete Guide , Jason Thompson refers to it as a &quot; charming comedy &quot; and a &quot; quiet master of the four-panel form &quot; , praising the series comedic timing and use of running gags .
he felt one of the series &apos; best points was its &quot; character-driven writing &quot; , but does warn that its moe nature and the jokes that revolve around the &quot; vaguely pedophilic teacher &quot; might disturb some newer readers of manga .
he later said that Azumanga Daioh was an &quot; almost totally innocent &quot; kind of moe , centered around &quot; peep &#91; ing &#93; at the chaste world of girls &quot; , in which &quot; adorable girls do adorable things &quot; .
the French manga dictionary Dicomanga noted that despite being a moe series targeted at otaku , it also appealed to female readers for celebrating &quot; friendships between girls as well as &#91; its &#93; comedy .
&quot; Marc Hairston describes Azumanga Daioh as being &quot; slightly disjointed &quot; , with &quot; frequently oblique &quot; and &quot; culturally biased &quot; humour , and says it is both &quot; lighter &quot; and &quot; more wry &quot; than Maria-sama ga Miteru .
he describes the characters of Azumanga as being &quot; individuals with slightly offbeat personalities &quot; .
Mark Thomas , writing for Mania .
com , says that each character has &quot; a defining personality trait that is ramped up to abnormal levels &quot; and that each has a foil , which highlights these traits and prevents them from becoming too annoying or unbelievable as characters .

Patrick King , writing for Anime Fringe , considered it to be &quot; one of the funniest , most adorable manga series I &apos;ve read &quot; .
IGN noted the lack of background art , but said that the expressive faces of the characters made up for it .
Fred Patton of Animation World Magazine described the anime as &quot; delightfully witty and even an educational window onto what Japanese high school life is really like .
&quot; Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD , stated that &quot; There &apos;s a lot to laugh with here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don &apos;t .
&quot; Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that &quot; The character of the girls is extremely well brought out .
the superb observation , and ability to capture expression , makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements .
the action , and very rich comedy , are also wonderfully represented .
there is just so much meaning , and charm , in even the most minor of expressions .

typhoon Melor , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Nona , was a powerful tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines in December 2015 .
45 billion ( US $ 136 .
4 million ) in damage .
the typhoon began developing on December 7 as a low-pressure area 120 km ( 75 mi ) of Chuuk .
soon , it intensified into a tropical depression on December 10 , and then into a tropical storm south of Yap , and was named Melor .
the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAG-ASA ) initially decided to name Melor as &quot; Nonoy &quot; , but due to political reasons , it was named &quot; Nona &quot; instead .
on December 13 , Tropical Storm Melor ( Nona ) became a typhoon , and made its first landfall on Northern Samar .
the typhoon made several landfalls in Sorsogon , Burias Island , Romblon , and Oriental Mindoro , before weakening into a tropical storm .
the JMA , however , upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm immediately after issuing that TCFA and named it Melor , when the storm was only about 50 km ( 31 mi ) south of Yap .
in the afternoon , the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression and designated it as 28W , just six hours before the center upgraded Melor to a tropical storm that was tracking west-northwestward along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge .
the PAGASA was about to name the tropical storm as Nonoy , yet it was named Nona after entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility on December 12 , owing to political reasons .
when Melor was forming an eye in the afternoon , the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm .
due to low vertical wind shear , warm sea surface temperatures above 28ºC and robust poleward outflow enhanced by a very powerful Aleutian low , Melor intensified into a typhoon early on December 13 , as tightly curved spiral banding was observed wrapping into a tiny but clear eye .
the JTWC upgraded Melor to a SSHWS Category 4-equivalent typhoon at noon .
although the eye appeared to be cloud-filled temporarily , the eyewall consolidated further .
Melor made landfall over Batag Island of Laoang , Northern Samar of the Philippines at 11 : 00 PST ( 03 : 00 UTC ) on December 14 .
the JMA reported a peak intensity of ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) and a central pressure of 935 hPa ( 27 .
the typhoon formed a well-defined eye and then maintained it for several hours while crossing the northern coast of Samar .
later , it made its second landfall over Bulusan , Sorsogon at 16 : 00 PST ( 08 : 00 UTC ) and third landfall over Burias Island at 21 : 45 PST ( 13 : 45 UTC ) , resulting in a cloud-filled eye again .
in preparation for the typhoon , 700,000 residents in several provinces were evacuated .
a no-sail zone was implemented in areas where the typhoon was expected to pass .
3 was raised on Catanduanes , Sorsogon , Albay , Northern Samar , Eastern Samar , and Samar .
1 on Batangas , Cavite , Rizal , Laguna , and the rest of Quezon ( including Polilio Island ) .
the Metro Manila Development Authority ( MMDA ) placed a yellow alert on Metro Manila as Typhoon Nona approached Mindoro .
1 was raised on Metro Manila when the typhoon neared Northern Samar .
on December 14 , Typhoon Nona ( Melor ) first made its first landfall on Batag Island on Northern Samar .
on the same day , it made its second landfall in Sorsogon .
typhoon Nona caused most devastation in Mindoro and Romblon .
Oriental Mindoro was placed under a state of calamity due to the devastation caused by the typhoon .
Pinamalayan in Oriental Mindoro was worst hit , with 15,000 homes destroyed , 24,000 families ( 108,000 people ) in evacuation centers , and property damages amounting to ₱ 325,025,710 .
96 , including agriculture and infrastructure .
forty people were killed during the typhoon , and damages amounted to ₱ 6 .
water levels of reservoirs rose , especially at Angat Dam .
damages to agriculture cost ₱ 2 .
8 billion , and more than 168,000 houses were damaged or destroyed .
several roads were also closed due to the typhoon .
more than 200,000 people stayed on evacuation centers due to the effects of the typhoon .
a state of calamity was declared on the whole country under Presidential Decree ( P.
) 1186 to speed up rescue , recovery , relief and rehabilitation operations following the devastation by the typhoon .
several areas in Central Luzon , mostly in Nueva Ecija , Bulacan , Pampanga , Tarlac , Isabela , and Aurora , were flooded by rain caused by Typhoon Nona .
however , owing to its similarity to President Benigno Aquino III &apos;s nickname , &quot; Noynoy &quot; , PAGASA renamed the typhoon &quot; Nona &quot; , despite that name &apos;s usage during 2011 .
PAGASA announced that the name Nona will also be retired .
